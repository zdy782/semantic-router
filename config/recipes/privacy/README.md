# Privacy-First Routing Recipe Model Card

## Overview

Privacy-First Routing keeps sensitive and suspicious requests on a local model.
Only clearly non-sensitive requests that need deeper reasoning may use the
configured frontier lane; ordinary requests also default to local processing.

This policy reduces accidental cloud exposure, but it cannot by itself prove
that a backend, network, or storage system is private.

## Model details

| Lane | Reference alias | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Local | `local/private-qwen` | Default, sensitive-data, and attack-containment traffic. |
| Frontier | `cloud/frontier-reasoning` | Explicitly non-sensitive, high-effort reasoning. |
| Visual | `local/omni` | Local image understanding with restricted tool access. |

Clients use `vllm-sr/auto`. Replace both aliases with backends that match the
deployment's data-handling policy.

## Intended use

Use this recipe for:

- prompts containing personal, confidential, or proprietary information;
- deployments with a local-only handling requirement;
- private image-bearing requests that require local visual understanding;
- suspicious prompts that should not receive tools or leave the local boundary;
- mixed workloads where a frontier model is allowed only for non-sensitive
  reasoning; and
- teams that need a local fallback for every unmatched request.

Do not use it as the sole control for regulated data. Network isolation,
backend ownership, logging, retention, and access controls remain necessary.

## Routing behavior

| Request pattern | Route | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Jailbreak or attack signal | `local_security_containment` | Keep the request local with containment policy. |
| Image content without an attack signal | `omni` | Use the local visual-language model with filtered tools. |
| PII, private-context, or local-only signal | `local_privacy_policy` | Keep the request local with privacy-oriented reasoning. |
| Clearly non-sensitive deep reasoning | `cloud_frontier_reasoning` | Use the configured frontier backend. |
| Everything else | `local_standard` | Use the local model with local-only tool access. |

Security and privacy decisions outrank the frontier route. The frontier route
requires positive reasoning evidence and exclusion of privacy or attack
signals.

Direct local-handling instructions and prohibitions on external transfer constrain
the route independently of learned privacy scores. All local routes restrict
tools to `local_search` and `local_read`; security containment removes tools.
Only the frontier route permits external tools. The scoped English and Chinese
patterns distinguish ordinary quotations from handling instructions. Mixed
requests with a recognized handling instruction stay local even when other
parts quote a phrase. These patterns are not a security DLP system or proof
of where an operator-provided tool executes.

The effort projection combines the observed reasoning similarity with independent
request, structure, context, and complexity evidence. The similarity contribution
alone cannot reach the frontier boundary. Its raw contribution does not mark the
embedding predicate as matched or change that predicate's threshold. Missing or
failed learned evidence cannot establish permission to use the frontier route.
An unresolved security, privacy, or frontier decision fails the request instead
of falling back without a decision tool policy. A known local restriction can
still resolve independently of unrelated missing effort evidence.

## Requirements

- Local OpenAI-compatible text and visual-language backends controlled by the operator.
- A frontier backend only if policy permits it.
- Jailbreak, PII, privacy-KB, embedding, context, structure, and complexity
  signals configured in [`config.yaml`](config.yaml).
- Logging and replay settings that match the deployment's retention policy.

## Data handling and safety

Routing happens before provider invocation. Requests selected for local lanes
still pass through the Router and any enabled supporting stores or logs. Review
those components before claiming end-to-end local processing. Treat classifier
errors as possible: conservative fallbacks reduce risk but do not eliminate it.

All five checked-in routes enable in-memory Router Replay. The effective replay
defaults capture up to 2 KiB each from the request and response body, including
the local security-containment and privacy routes. Local model placement does
not make that replay data harmless. Disable body capture or replay when prompts
and responses must not be retained, and apply the same access controls to the
replay store as to the original traffic.

## Quick start

```bash
vllm-sr serve
```

In the Dashboard, connect Models that match the required data boundaries,
choose **Privacy-First Routing** in **Recipes**, assign every decision, and
publish the resulting Mixture-of-Model Entrypoint.

## Evaluation

The probes cover PII, local-only requests, jailbreak and attack prompts,
non-sensitive reasoning, multilingual variants, priority collisions, and the
local fallback. See [`probes.yaml`](probes.yaml) and the
[conformance guide](../CONFORMANCE.md).

## Limitations

- Classifiers may miss sensitive content or produce false positives.
- A local alias is private only when its endpoint, network, storage, and logs
  are also controlled appropriately.
- The recipe does not redact captured request or response bodies by default.
- The frontier route should be removed entirely in environments that prohibit
  all external inference.
