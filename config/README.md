The website's [configuration guide](../website/docs/installation/configuration.md)
is the reader-facing reference. `config/config.yaml` is intentionally exhaustive;
trim it for a deployment instead of treating every optional service as required.

## Canonical shape

A router config uses these top-level sections:

```yaml
version: v0.3
listeners: []
providers: {}
routing: {}
entrypoints: []
recipes: []
global: {}
```

- `listeners` exposes inference and management endpoints.
- `providers.defaults` defines shared provider behavior;
  `providers.models[]` binds model names to concrete backends and owns their
  deployment pricing metadata. A built-in model may add an optional `catalog`
  identity, while `backend_refs[].provider` selects the stable runtime Provider
  ID. Custom vLLM/SGLang models continue to omit `catalog`.
- `routing` owns model cards, signals, projections, decisions, and the routing
  strategy for the default profile.
- `entrypoints` maps request-facing model names to isolated `recipes`. Each
  recipe has its own signals, decisions, algorithms, and plugins while sharing
  providers and router-wide services. See
  [`tutorials/global/entrypoints-and-recipes.md`](../website/docs/tutorials/global/entrypoints-and-recipes.md).
- `global` owns cross-cutting router settings, services, stores, integrations,
  and router-managed model assets.

Validate a file before serving it:

```bash
vllm-sr config validate --config config.yaml
vllm-sr serve --config config.yaml
```

The [Vela model guide](../website/docs/tutorials/global/vela-models.md) explains
the built-in model defaults, explicit older models, and opt-in long-context
deployment settings. Model migration preserves the existing input budgets.

`src/semantic-router/pkg/configschema/router-config-v0.3.schema.json` is the one
checked-in schema generated from the Go configuration types and routing
registries. Do not edit it directly. See the
[Configuration Contract](../website/docs/installation/configuration-contract.md)
for schema discovery, semantic validation, and the extension workflow.

## Choose the right asset

### Fragments

Fragments show one capability in its owning section. They are not complete
deployments and may rely on model or service definitions from a base config.

- `config/fragments/signal/`: request and response facts used by decisions.
  Heuristic and learned signal guides live under
  `tutorials/signal/heuristic/` and `tutorials/signal/learned/`.
- `config/fragments/decision/`: `single`, `and`, `or`, `not`, and nested
  boolean rule shapes. Classifier-backed rules may resolve a terminal
  `Unknown` result with `on_unknown: no_match|match|fail_request`.
- `config/fragments/algorithm/`: per-decision model selection and bounded
  multi-model execution policies.
- `config/fragments/plugin/`: route-local request or response processing such
  as caching, memory, RAG, tool policy, and safety handling.

The corresponding website sections are
[`tutorials/signal/`](../website/docs/tutorials/signal/),
[`tutorials/decision/`](../website/docs/tutorials/decision/),
[`tutorials/algorithm/`](../website/docs/tutorials/algorithm/),
[`tutorials/plugin/`](../website/docs/tutorials/plugin/), and
[`tutorials/global/`](../website/docs/tutorials/global/).

### Recipes and built-in models

`config/recipes/` contains complete, runnable examples. Read a recipe's Model
Card before using it; the card explains its intended use, backend roles, data
handling, evaluation scope, and limitations.

`config/recipes/built-in/` is the versioned source for virtual models bundled
with the distribution. Dashboard presents these under **Build →
Mixture-of-Models → Recipes** and lets operators assign connected Models
without editing provider credentials into a Recipe.

### Runtime examples

`config/runtime/` contains backend-specific support files for memory, response
cache, the Response API, tools, and vector stores. These files configure a
runtime dependency; they do not define routing behavior by themselves.

## Important boundaries

- Model backend credentials belong in environment references, not literal YAML
  values.
- Catalog-backed models materialize their built-in Model Card, reasoning family,
  provider protocol, path, and non-secret defaults automatically. A handwritten
  override uses the canonical `catalog` identity as `routing.modelCards[].name`;
  a fully custom model uses its request alias as the card name.
- `api_format` selects the upstream wire format; it never selects a Provider.
  When this config declares a listener, every physical model must use
  `backend_refs` with an explicit Provider ID. Metadata-only external-gateway
  configs (`listeners: []`) and built-in virtual models may remain backendless.
  The local `vllm-sr serve` path manages an Envoy listener, so it rejects a
  backendless physical model even when the authored listener list is empty;
  deploy state-only metadata through the external-gateway integration instead.
- Multiple `backend_refs` on one alias are homogeneous replicas. HTTP targets
  may vary by host, port, and weight. HTTPS targets may vary by port and weight
  but must keep one DNS hostname. Provider ID, wire protocol, native model ID,
  credentials, headers, request path, and TLS semantics must also match; use
  separate aliases for heterogeneous providers.
- `routing.modelCards` describes semantic capabilities; concrete URLs,
  credentials, and pricing belong in `providers.models`.
- Protocol controls such as `tool_choice` enter routing as conversation facts;
  projections combine those facts with text-derived intent before decisions
  apply policy.
- `routing.projections` derives named routing outputs from signals. Decisions
  consume those outputs instead of embedding free-form computation.
- Candidate iteration is bounded policy metadata, not a general scripting
  runtime.
- `routing.decisions[].algorithm.minimum_candidates` keeps a model-free Recipe
  portable while making its candidate-pool cardinality executable as soon as
  an Entrypoint assigns Models. Request-time context filtering cannot silently
  reduce the eligible pool below that contract.
- Router Learning lives under `global.router.learning`; it is separate from a
  decision's request-time base algorithm.
- Router replay is disabled by default and can capture request or response
  bodies. Review its access controls and retention settings before enabling it.
- `global.router.skip_processing.enabled` should be enabled only when an
  authenticated upstream component owns the bypass header.
- Knowledge bases are declared under `global.model_catalog.kbs[]`; routing
  signals bind to those shared assets by name.
- Built-in category/domain classification uses the local `variant` selector by
  default. A named remote classifier may instead be attached with
  `global.model_catalog.modules.classifier.domain.backend`; its `model` must
  name an entry in `global.model_catalog.external[]` with
  `model_role: classification`. The shared backend contract uses
  `protocol`, `contract`, `model`, and optional `deadline_ms`.
- Complexity attaches the same block at
  `global.model_catalog.modules.complexity.backend`, beside `prototype_scoring`
  rather than on a rule, so it survives the per-recipe replacement of
  `routing.signals`. It reads two contracts and therefore requires `contract`
  to be stated: `score.v1`, where each rule converts the score with its own
  `hard_above`/`easy_below` boundaries, or `label_distribution.v1`, where the
  winning label is the verdict. `threshold` stays the symmetric shorthand for
  the local signed margin, and the `hard`/`easy` candidate lists are unread
  once a backend supplies the score.
- PII attaches the same block at
  `global.model_catalog.modules.classifier.pii.backend`. It reads one contract,
  `token_spans.v1`, so `contract` may be omitted; the remote model returns
  entity spans as code-point offsets into the exact request string, and its
  labels must be in the configured `pii_mapping_path`. `on_error` beside the
  backend selects what a backend failure, or a provider-declared truncation,
  does to the rule that consumed it: `allow` (default) treats the content as
  not matching, `block` matches it as `classification_error`. A backend is
  mutually exclusive with the local `use_mmbert_32k` selector.
- External LLM classifiers use `max_response_bytes` on their
  `global.model_catalog.external[]` entry. The MCP classifier uses the same key
  under `global.model_catalog.modules.classifier.mcp`.

## Keep examples in sync

When a public config field or supported routing surface changes, update its Go
type or registry, then update its fragment, exhaustive reference, affected
recipes, and the matching website page together. Regenerate the
machine-readable contract before running the semantic and repository gates:

The focused semantic gate is `go test ./pkg/config/...`; `make check` applies
the complete changed-surface policy.

```bash
make config-schema-generate
make config-schema-check
go test ./pkg/config/...
make check
```

Complete routing scenarios belong in `config/recipes/`; backend support files
belong in `config/runtime/`; local Envoy and test-only manifests belong under
`deploy/` and `e2e/`, respectively.
