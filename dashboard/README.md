# Semantic Router Dashboard

The Dashboard is the authenticated control and observability UI for a Semantic
Router deployment. It combines a React frontend with a Go backend that serves
the SPA, stores dashboard state, and proxies Router, Envoy, Grafana,
Prometheus, and Jaeger endpoints.

Use it to:

- complete first-run model and recipe setup;
- inspect, edit, validate, deploy, and roll back Router configuration;
- import and activate Recipe packages;
- test routes in the Playground and inspect the selected path;
- view topology, logs, evaluations, and monitoring tools;
- manage security policies, ML selection workflows, MCP tools, and optional
  OpenClaw workers when those features are enabled.

The Dashboard is a control plane, not an inference proxy. Applications should
send inference requests to Envoy.

## Local development

Start the frontend and backend in separate terminals from the repository root:

```bash
make dashboard-dev-frontend
```

```bash
ROUTER_CONFIG_PATH="$PWD/config/config.yaml" \
TARGET_ROUTER_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080 \
TARGET_ENVOY_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8899 \
make dashboard-dev-backend
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:3001`. Vite proxies backend requests to port `8700`.
The Router and Envoy must be running for live config, status, and Playground
operations.

For the complete local stack, use the CLI instead:

```bash
vllm-sr serve --config config/config.yaml
vllm-sr dashboard
```

The current installation and first-run workflow is documented in
[`website/docs/installation/installation.md`](../website/docs/installation/installation.md).

## Build and test

```bash
make dashboard-build
make dashboard-check
make dashboard-test-e2e-evaluation
make dashboard-test-backend
```

The required `Dashboard` CI workflow runs `dashboard-check`, then the Evaluation
browser acceptance target shown above. Both gates are available locally; run
`dashboard-check` before every Dashboard change and the browser acceptance gate
when changing Evaluation UI or workflows. `dashboard-check` runs, in order:

| Step | What it covers |
| --- | --- |
| `dashboard-evaluation-catalog-check` | Verifies the generated Evaluation catalog mirrors match their canonical CLI sources. |
| `dashboard-lint` | ESLint on the frontend, golangci-lint on the backend |
| `dashboard-type-check` | TypeScript type checking (frontend + Knowledge Map) |
| `dashboard-test-frontend` | Frontend unit tests |
| `dashboard-test-backend` | `go test ./...` on `dashboard/backend`, including the real Go → sandboxed Python Evaluation worker contract |
| `dashboard-go-mod-tidy` | Verifies `go.mod` / `go.sum` are tidy |

The dashboard backend is a **separate Go module**, so `go test ./...` from the
repository root does not cover it. Use `make dashboard-test-backend`, or run
`go test ./...` from `dashboard/backend` directly.

Some backend tests shell out to the `vllm-sr` CLI (for example to regenerate Envoy
config), so they need its Python dependencies importable:

```bash
pip install -e src/vllm-sr
```

Without it, those tests fail with `ModuleNotFoundError`. CI installs the same package.

`dashboard-check` runs plain `go test`. The race detector roughly doubles the
runtime, which is a poor trade on every PR, so it is deliberately **not** in the
always-on gate. Run it locally before pushing concurrency-sensitive work — anything
touching shared state, goroutines, caches, or resolvers:

```bash
cd dashboard/backend && go test ./... -race
```

## Runtime configuration

The backend accepts matching command-line flags for these environment
variables. Defaults are defined in
[`backend/config/config.go`](backend/config/config.go).

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `DASHBOARD_PORT` | Backend listen port; default `8700`. |
| `DASHBOARD_STATIC_DIR` | Built frontend assets. |
| `ROUTER_CONFIG_PATH` | Canonical Router YAML read or updated by config APIs. |
| `DASHBOARD_CONFIG_DIR` | Directory for config versions and related state. |
| `TARGET_ROUTER_API_URL` | Router management API; default `http://localhost:8080`. |
| `TARGET_ROUTER_METRICS_URL` | Router Prometheus endpoint. |
| `TARGET_ENVOY_URL` | Inference endpoint used by Playground and route probes. |
| `TARGET_GRAFANA_URL` | Optional Grafana base URL. |
| `TARGET_PROMETHEUS_URL` | Optional Prometheus base URL. |
| `TARGET_JAEGER_URL` | Optional Jaeger base URL. |

Feature controls:

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `DASHBOARD_READONLY` | Hard-disable all config mutation. |
| `DASHBOARD_RUNTIME_CONFIG_WRITABLE` | Allow mutation of the mounted runtime config surface. |
| `DASHBOARD_RECIPE_STORE_WRITABLE` | Allow Recipe package import. |
| `DASHBOARD_SETUP_MODE` | Enable the trusted first-run setup flow. |
| `EVALUATION_ENABLED` | Enable evaluation jobs. |
| `EVALUATION_DATA_DIR` | Durable Evaluation Plane artifact store; default `./data/evaluation`. |
| `EVALUATION_DEPLOYMENTS_DIR` | Optional read-only directory containing a strict `evaluation-deployments.v1` `registry.json` plus relative deployment configs. Enables deployment-scoped baseline and candidate targets; unset preserves the single-runtime target. |
| `EVALUATION_ENVOY_API_KEY_ENV` | Optional server-owned environment variable name containing the Envoy evaluation credential; the browser never supplies or receives it. |
| `EVALUATION_AGENT_TASK_LEDGER_URL`, `_API_KEY_ENV`, `_TIMEOUT` | Optional typed server-owned endpoint for a complete sealed provider-observed agent-task ledger. Its credential and URL remain outside public catalog responses and worker argv. |
| `VLLM_SR_SOURCE_REVISION` | Immutable source identity required to create an evaluation run: a full 40-character Git commit or `sha256:` source-tree digest. Dashboard images set this from their build argument. |
| `ML_PIPELINE_ENABLED` | Enable benchmark, training, and config-generation jobs. |
| `ML_TRAINING_DIR` | Training script directory for subprocess mode. |
| `ML_SERVICE_URL` | Use an external ML service instead of local subprocesses. |
| `MCP_ENABLED` | Enable MCP server and tool management. |
| `OPENCLAW_ENABLED` | Enable OpenClaw provisioning and room workflows. |

Deployment registries support Linux and macOS through descriptor-relative reads
that reject symlinks in the registry path and its files. Use a canonical registry
directory; macOS also requires read permission on its directory components.
Other platforms reject a configured registry. Leaving `EVALUATION_DEPLOYMENTS_DIR`
unset retains the single-runtime target. Evaluation workers require Linux for
their sandbox.

Persistent SQLite paths include `DASHBOARD_AUTH_DB_PATH`,
`DASHBOARD_WORKFLOW_DB_PATH`, and `DASHBOARD_CONFIG_PROJECTION_DB_PATH`.
Evaluation evidence is not stored in SQLite: mount `EVALUATION_DATA_DIR` as
writable persistent storage so complete run bundles survive container restarts.
The Evaluation Plane fails closed unless its store and run directories are
private to the Dashboard process (`0700` directories and `0600` bundle files).
The Dashboard container defaults this store to `/app/data/evaluation`; its
entrypoint excludes that subtree from shared-data permission widening and
reapplies the private modes before every restart.

For a local multi-deployment experiment, export
`EVALUATION_DEPLOYMENTS_DIR` before the canonical `vllm-sr serve` command. The
CLI validates every host path component, mounts the directory read-only into
Dashboard only, and rewrites the environment value to the container path.
Router and Envoy do not inherit the mount or variable. The registry accepts
only deployment ID/name/description, a confined relative config path, and exact
Router/Envoy origins. It rejects symlinks, traversal, unknown fields,
duplicates, and literal credential or ledger configuration. Public catalog
responses expose the safe deployment label but never origins, paths, or secret
references. See the [Evaluation Plane guide](../website/docs/benchmarking/evaluation-plane.md#address-baseline-and-candidate-deployments-together)
for the versioned schema and controlled-pair contract.

Dashboard image builds accept `VLLM_SR_SOURCE_REVISION` as a build argument and
embed it in the runtime image. The Dockerfile default is `unavailable`, which
keeps the Dashboard usable but makes Evaluation Plane run creation fail closed;
release and CI builds must pass an immutable full commit or source-tree digest.
Repository Make targets derive the full commit from a clean checkout and a
deterministic `sha256:` source-tree digest from tracked or untracked local
changes. Git-ignored caches and environments are excluded. Callers may still
override the value with `VLLM_SR_SOURCE_REVISION` when reproducing a separately
attested source tree.

## Authentication and write safety

Set a stable `DASHBOARD_JWT_SECRET` and provision the first administrator with
`DASHBOARD_ADMIN_EMAIL`, `DASHBOARD_ADMIN_PASSWORD`, and optionally
`DASHBOARD_ADMIN_NAME`. Public web-form bootstrap is disabled by default; only
set `DASHBOARD_ALLOW_OPEN_BOOTSTRAP=true` in a controlled first-run environment.

Writes authenticated by the session cookie must carry an `X-CSRF-Token` header
and a matching `Origin`. The frontend does this on its own. Set
`DASHBOARD_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` to a comma-separated list when the browser's origin
differs from the backend's `Host`, as behind a reverse proxy or the Vite dev
proxy (`http://localhost:3001`). Unset, the origin check is advisory and the
CSRF token is the guarantee. `Authorization: Bearer` requests are exempt.

The same list governs the ClawRoom WebSocket handshake. CORS does not apply to
handshakes, so the origin check is the only cross-origin control there; a
split-origin frontend that is not listed can authenticate and write but cannot
open the room socket.

Evaluation Plane evidence APIs are intentionally stricter: they accept browser
requests only when `Origin` exactly matches the request scheme and `Host`.
TLS-terminating proxies must overwrite `X-Forwarded-Proto` with the external
scheme; arbitrary sibling origins never receive credentialed CORS headers.

Read-only mode and the two writable-surface flags are independent. A read-only
ConfigMap, GitOps-owned config, or read-only Recipe store should be reflected in
the matching flag so the UI does not offer operations the runtime cannot
persist.

Some local workflows can manage containers. Do not mount a container-runtime
socket unless users with Dashboard access are allowed to control that runtime.
See the [security hardening guide](../website/docs/installation/security-hardening.md)
for the deployment boundary.

## Session contract

Browsers authenticate with the `vsr_session` cookie the backend sets at login,
and with nothing else. It is `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax`, and `Secure` behind
HTTPS, so page script cannot read it and the browser attaches it to same-origin
requests on its own — `fetch`, `EventSource`, `WebSocket`, and iframes alike.
The frontend does not store, copy, or forward it.

- **`?authToken=` is not accepted.** The backend used to read a session token
  from the query string, which put a live credential into reverse-proxy access
  logs, browser history, and the `Referer` header. Any saved link or automation
  still using it now receives `401`; move it to `Authorization: Bearer`.
  Token-shaped query parameters are redacted from the logs the dashboard writes,
  because old links keep arriving for a while.
- **Non-browser clients use `Authorization: Bearer`.** `POST /api/auth/login`
  returns the token in its response body for exactly this case. Bearer requests
  are exempt from the CSRF check described above, since a browser never attaches
  that header by itself.
- **`vsr_csrf` is readable by script on purpose.** The frontend reads it and
  copies the value into `X-CSRF-Token` on every unsafe request
  ([`frontend/src/utils/authFetch.ts`](frontend/src/utils/authFetch.ts)), which
  is why it is not `HttpOnly`. It is not a credential: it authenticates nothing
  on its own, and the server recomputes the expected value from the session id
  inside the session token rather than reading the cookie back, so planting one
  achieves nothing without the session cookie as well.
- **`SameSite=Lax` is deliberate.** `Strict` would withhold the cookie from
  top-level navigation into the dashboard, so following a link from chat or an
  alert would land on the login page despite a valid session. `Lax` still
  withholds it from cross-site subrequests and form posts, and the CSRF token
  covers what is left.

## Setup mode contract

Setup mode is the dashboard's first-run state. While it is active the UI forces the setup wizard and the **unauthenticated** first-admin bootstrap endpoint (`/api/auth/bootstrap/register`) is open, so what turns it on and off is a security boundary, not a cosmetic flag.

- **`setup.mode` in the router config file declares setup mode, and nothing else does.** It is read live from disk, behind an mtime+size cache, by one resolver (`dashboard/backend/setupmode`). Every surface derives from that single value: the bootstrap gate, `/api/setup/state`, `/api/settings`, and the setup write endpoints (`validate`, `activate`, `import-remote`).
- **What it enables:** the setup wizard, and creation of the first admin without logging in. Both end together.
- **It ends automatically when activation rewrites the config, with no restart.** Activation strips the `setup` block and the resolver's cache is invalidated in the same request, so the bootstrap endpoint closes at the moment setup finishes. Activation restarts the router and Envoy but deliberately not the dashboard, which is why the state must be read live rather than captured at startup.
- **`--setup-mode` / `DASHBOARD_SETUP_MODE` is deprecated and ignored.** It is still read, but only so that a value disagreeing with the config file can be reported: `/api/setup/state` returns a `reason`, and the backend logs one `WARNING` per change (not per request, since the endpoint is unauthenticated). A stale environment value can no longer open bootstrap on its own.
- **An unreadable or unparsable config resolves to "not in setup mode", deliberately.** Failing closed is the only safe posture for something gating unauthenticated admin creation; the resolver never falls back to the legacy flag on an error path. `/api/setup/state` answers `200` with a diagnostic `reason` (rather than a `500` the frontend silently coerced to "not in setup mode") so the condition is visible instead of silent. The reason never contains config file contents.
- **`--allow-open-bootstrap` is a separate, still-supported operator escape hatch.** It is unaffected by setup-mode resolution and has no config-file counterpart. Production should provision the admin via `DASHBOARD_ADMIN_*` rather than enabling it.

## Router contract access

The **System → Platform & Access → Router API Docs** entry opens the running
Router's Swagger UI through the authenticated Dashboard origin. Its companion
proxies are `/api/router/api/v1` and `/api/router/openapi.json`; they expose the
Router's `/api/v1` and `/openapi.json` responses through the existing read-only
management proxy and do not maintain another API definition. Agents should
query the Router endpoints directly and do not depend on the Dashboard.
