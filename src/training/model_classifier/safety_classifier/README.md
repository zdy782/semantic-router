# mmBERT-32K Safety Classifier Training

For the Vela generation, see the [application recipes](../vela-applications.md).
They preserve historical recipes below while defining the new data, label,
training and independent evaluation contracts.

This package trains two hierarchical content-safety classifiers on the current
mmBERT-32K foundation:

- Level 1: binary `safe` / `unsafe` prompt classification;
- Level 2: the historical nine-output hazard classifier, explicitly versioned
  as `legacy-9-v1`.

The checked workflow produces deterministic checkpoints from the pinned
`llm-semantic-router/mmbert-32k-yarn` base. Release receipts capture the base,
data inputs, dependencies, evaluation, and artifact checksums. Publication is
non-overwriting by default.

The two existing collection artifacts, `mmbert-safety-binary-merged` and
`mmbert-safety-binary-hazard`, are PEFT adapters for
`jhu-clsp/mmBERT-base`. Despite its suffix, the first artifact is not a full
merged model. Load existing adapters with the base declared in their
`adapter_config.json`; use the 32K base only for checkpoints produced by this
workflow.

## Training Contract

The machine-readable source of truth is
[`configs/training-v1.json`](configs/training-v1.json). It pins:

- base-model and dataset revisions;
- raw input-file SHA-256 digests;
- prompt-only normalization, de-duplication, split precedence, and sampling;
- the `legacy-9-v1` source-taxonomy crosswalk;
- max length 512;
- disabled ModernBERT reference compilation so distributed ranks do not each
  create a large TorchInductor worker pool;
- LoRA rank 32, alpha 64, dropout 0.1, and the four ModernBERT target modules;
- global batch 64, 10 epochs, AdamW, linear warmup, and all random seeds;
- distinct adapter and merged release artifacts.

Compatibility settings and workflow decisions remain explicit in the contract
and public documentation. A new run should retain its complete receipt so its
configuration can be distinguished from an existing published checkpoint.

## Data Contract

`data.py prepare` downloads only pinned files and verifies their hashes. It
uses AEGIS `prompt` and `prompt_label`; response/refusal variants are excluded.
Empty and redacted prompts are removed. Fingerprints use NFKC normalization,
Unicode whitespace collapse, case folding, and SHA-256, while the original
stripped text remains the model input.

Holdout precedence is `test > validation > train`. Any lower-precedence
duplicate is removed before sampling, and conflicting-label fingerprint groups
are dropped entirely.

- Level 1 emits 10,000 training rows per label without replacement.
- Level 2 emits 2,000 rows per label. Underrepresented classes use documented,
  deterministic oversampling; validation and test remain natural-distribution
  AEGIS data.
- Multi-hazard AEGIS rows use the first mapped category in the dataset's source
  order. All mapped targets remain in each row for audit and strict-subset
  evaluation.

## Lightweight Validation

The data, taxonomy, metrics, contract, and artifact-shape tests require only
the Python standard library:

```bash
python -m unittest discover \
  -s src/training/model_classifier/safety_classifier/tests \
  -p 'test_*.py' -v
```

## ROCm Environment

The Dockerfile uses an immutable official ROCm/PyTorch base digest. Build it
from the repository root:

```bash
docker build \
  -f src/training/model_classifier/safety_classifier/Dockerfile.rocm \
  -t semantic-router-mmbert32k-safety:training-v1 .
```

The image carries conservative single-node RCCL defaults verified for the
eight-device workflow: scratch reclaim is disabled, GPU P2P is disabled in
favor of shared-memory collectives, and the channel count is capped at eight.
These settings trade some collective bandwidth for bounded startup time; LoRA
gradient communication is small relative to the frozen base model. The trainer
also fences every distributed checkpoint save before deriving the best-model
path on each rank. This avoids a Transformers 4.55 race in which rank zero can
enter the load-best barrier while another rank has not yet observed the newly
created checkpoint directory.

Mount the repository, a persistent Hugging Face cache, and credentials using
the normal secret mechanism for the environment. Do not copy tokens into the
image or repository.

## Prepare Once

Data preparation must run once, before distributed launch, rather than once per
rank:

```bash
python -m src.training.model_classifier.safety_classifier.data prepare \
  --contract src/training/model_classifier/safety_classifier/configs/training-v1.json \
  --output-dir /artifacts/data
```

The command writes deterministic JSONL splits and manifests under
`/artifacts/data/{level1,level2}`. Keep this directory outside Git.

## Eight-Accelerator Training

The checked contract reproduces global batch 64 as `8 samples × 8 ranks × 1`
gradient accumulation step:

```bash
VLLM_SR_SOURCE_COMMIT="$(git rev-parse HEAD)" \
  torchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node=8 \
  -m src.training.model_classifier.safety_classifier.train \
  --task level1 \
  --expected-world-size 8 \
  --data-dir /artifacts/data \
  --output-dir /artifacts/runs/level1

VLLM_SR_SOURCE_COMMIT="$(git rev-parse HEAD)" \
  torchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node=8 \
  -m src.training.model_classifier.safety_classifier.train \
  --task level2 \
  --expected-world-size 8 \
  --data-dir /artifacts/data \
  --output-dir /artifacts/runs/level2
```

`VLLM_SR_SOURCE_COMMIT` is mandatory for a release-eligible container run when
the mounted checkout is not trusted by the container's Git configuration. The
trainer validates it as a full immutable Git SHA; missing provenance makes the
run non-release-eligible, and the release command does not substitute a mutable
revision.

Use `--max-steps 2` for an accelerator smoke. Override runs are marked
non-release-eligible in `training_manifest.json`.

## Evaluate, Merge, and Publish

Run independent evaluation against the materialized test split, then merge and
compare logits:

```bash
python -m src.training.model_classifier.safety_classifier.evaluate \
  --task level1 \
  --model /artifacts/runs/level1/adapter \
  --artifact-type adapter \
  --data /artifacts/data/level1/test.jsonl \
  --output-dir /artifacts/runs/level1/evaluation

python -m src.training.model_classifier.safety_classifier.export \
  --task level1 \
  --run-root /artifacts/runs/level1 \
  --merged-dir /artifacts/runs/level1-merged
```

Repeat for Level 2. Publication refuses existing repositories by default and
performs a remote checksum plus load/inference verification:

```bash
python -m src.training.model_classifier.safety_classifier.release \
  --task level1 \
  --run-root /artifacts/runs/level1 \
  --merged-dir /artifacts/runs/level1-merged
```

Every published adapter contains `adapter_model.safetensors`; every merged
repository contains full `model.safetensors` weights. Both include label,
contract, data, dependency, metric, parity, and file-checksum manifests.

## Explicit v2 candidate recipe

`configs/training-v1.json` remains the historical 512-token recipe. The separate
`configs/training-v2.json` trains up to 2048 tokens on the pinned 32K backbone,
keeps the same binary and legacy nine-class hazard IDs, and preserves global
batch 64 through gradient accumulation. It uses validation to select the best
checkpoint and leaves final-test inference to a separate frozen-candidate run.
A device count is not a model-quality criterion in v2.

Pass the v2 contract to both data preparation and training; their contract
hashes must match. On one GPU the configured microbatch is 8 with eight
accumulation steps. Training at 2048 does not establish 32K accuracy: evaluate
4K/8K/16K/32K inputs with relevant content at the beginning, middle, and end,
including safe quotations and negated harmful requests. Report full-context
and windowed results separately. The hazard head covers `legacy-9-v1`, not all
thirteen contemporary hazard categories, and its scores on safe content are
not themselves an unsafe decision.
