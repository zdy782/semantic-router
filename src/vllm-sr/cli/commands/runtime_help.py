Start vLLM Semantic Router.

Serve uses --config or config.yaml and preserves the Dashboard-first setup flow.
Connect physical models and publish Mixture-of-Model entrypoints in the
Dashboard, then keep the same stack running with this single command.

Virtual models are routing policies. Semantic Router starts Router, Envoy, the
Dashboard, and supporting services; it does not download or launch the physical
LLM engines referenced by provider backends. Connect user-owned single or
multiple model endpoints through one canonical config or the Dashboard.

Ports are configured in the selected config under the listeners section.

Local startup waits up to 1800 seconds for Router readiness, or Dashboard
readiness during first-run setup. Use --startup-timeout SECONDS for a different
positive budget when model loading or GPU compilation needs more time.
The wait begins after containers start. It does not change inference deadlines.
Timeout exits the CLI with an error and leaves containers available for inspection.

DEPLOYMENT TARGETS:

\b
docker  - Local Docker deployment (default)
k8s     - Kubernetes deployment via Helm

MODEL SELECTION ALGORITHMS:

\b
static     - Use first configured model (default, no learning)
router_dc  - Query-model matching via embedding similarity
automix    - Cost-quality optimization using POMDP
hybrid     - Combine multiple methods with configurable weights
workflows  - Router Flow static/dynamic micro-agent orchestration
latency_aware - TPOT/TTFT percentile-aware selection
knn        - KNN selector using shared ML model-selection settings
kmeans     - KMeans selector using shared ML model-selection settings
svm        - SVM selector using shared ML model-selection settings
mlp        - MLP selector using shared ML model-selection settings
multi_factor - Quality, latency, cost, and load scoring

Cross-request learning lives under global.router.learning.adaptation and
global.router.learning.protection instead of --algorithm.

Examples:

\b
  # Dashboard-first setup or an existing ./config.yaml
  vllm-sr serve
  # User-owned single or multi-model topology
  vllm-sr serve --config my-models.yaml
  # Explicitly replace Dashboard-edited runtime state from reviewed source YAML
  vllm-sr serve --config my-models.yaml --replace-active-config
  # Deploy a user-owned config to Kubernetes
  vllm-sr serve --target k8s --config my-models.yaml --namespace my-ns
  # Runtime policy and image overrides
  vllm-sr serve --algorithm latency_aware
  vllm-sr serve --image-pull-policy always
  vllm-sr serve --readonly
  vllm-sr serve --minimal
  vllm-sr serve --log-level debug
  # AMD ROCm image, device passthrough, and router internal GPU defaults
  vllm-sr serve --platform amd
  vllm-sr serve --platform amd --startup-timeout 7200
  VLLM_SR_AMD_ROUTER_VISIBLE_DEVICES=7 vllm-sr serve --platform amd
