# Router API

The router data plane accepts model requests through an Envoy listener. In the
standard local stack, the listener is `http://localhost:8899`; a recipe can
choose a different address or port under `listeners`.

Use the data plane for inference. Use the management API, normally bound to
`127.0.0.1:8080`, for health checks, configuration, diagnostics, and replay
queries. See [Router management API](./apiserver).

## Supported inference paths

| Method | Path | Client format | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `POST` | `/v1/chat/completions` | OpenAI Chat Completions | Main routed inference endpoint |
| `POST` | `/v1/responses` | OpenAI Responses | Requires the Responses service to be enabled |
| `GET` | `/v1/responses/{id}` | OpenAI Responses | Reads a stored response |
| `DELETE` | `/v1/responses/{id}` | OpenAI Responses | Deletes a stored response |
| `GET` | `/v1/responses/{id}/input_items` | OpenAI Responses | Reads stored input items |
| `POST` | `/v1/messages` | Anthropic Messages | The router translates when the selected backend uses another protocol |
| `GET` | `/v1/models` | OpenAI Models | Lists models exposed by the active router configuration |

Other `/v1/*` paths fail closed. In particular, `/v1/files`,
`/v1/vector_stores`, and Router Replay paths are not available on a public
inference listener. Router-owned file and vector-store operations use
`/api/v1/storage/files` and `/api/v1/storage/vector-stores` on the management
listener.

See [Protocol Compatibility](../installation/protocol-compatibility) for the
client-to-backend translation matrix, backend `api_format` values, and
field-level portability boundaries.

## Send a routed request

Use an auto-model or recipe entrypoint when you want the router to select a
backend. Use a concrete model name when you want to bypass semantic model
selection and target that model directly.

```bash
curl -sS http://localhost:8899/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "model": "auto",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Write a Python function that merges two sorted lists."
      }
    ]
  }'
```

The response keeps the client protocol's shape. Its model, content, token
usage, and optional router headers depend on the selected backend and recipe.
See [VSR routing headers](../troubleshooting/vsr-headers) for the stable
observability contract.

The model names accepted by the Router come from canonical provider entries.
`name` is the logical alias used by decisions and clients,
`provider_model_id` is sent to the upstream provider, and
`providers.models[].backend_refs[]` identifies the physical endpoint:

```yaml
providers:
  models:
    - name: local-small
      provider_model_id: served-model
      api_format: openai
      pricing:
        currency: USD
        prompt_per_1m: 0
        completion_per_1m: 0
      backend_refs:
        - name: local-vllm
          endpoint: model-server:8000
          protocol: http
          provider: vllm
          weight: 1
```

Pricing is operator-supplied deployment metadata, not a live quote. It stays on
`providers.models[]`; `routing.modelCards` only describes semantic capabilities.
`currency` is optional and resolves to `USD` for accounting when omitted. When set,
it must be an uppercase three-letter code. All per-million-token rates must be finite
and non-negative. `cached_input_per_1m` and `cache_write_per_1m` are optional, and an
explicit zero represents a free rate.

`api_format` declares the upstream wire contract: `openai` for Chat
Completions, `responses` for the OpenAI Responses API, or `anthropic` for
Anthropic Messages. The client may use any supported inference path; the Router
translates once at the provider boundary and returns the client's original wire
format.

### Responses API

```bash
curl -sS http://localhost:8899/v1/responses \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "model": "auto",
    "input": "Summarize the trade-offs of retrieval-augmented generation."
  }'
```

Creating, retrieving, and deleting Responses API objects requires its backing
service and store. When Responses API support is disabled, the collection
endpoint returns `404` and stored-object handling is unavailable. A configured
service retains objects according to its own storage and retention settings.

### Anthropic Messages

```bash
curl -sS http://localhost:8899/v1/messages \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'anthropic-version: 2023-06-01' \
  -d '{
    "model": "auto",
    "max_tokens": 256,
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Explain semantic routing in one paragraph."
      }
    ]
  }'
```

Protocol translation is limited to fields the router supports. When a request
crosses protocols, inspect `x-vsr-client-protocol`,
`x-vsr-upstream-protocol`, and any `x-vsr-protocol-warnings` response header.

## Router Replay

Router Replay records routing decisions and selected request lifecycle data.
It is useful for debugging, evaluation, and Router Learning, but it does not
change routing merely because a record is read.

Replay is disabled unless the service is enabled:

```yaml
global:
  services:
    router_replay:
      enabled: true
      store_backend: memory
```

The in-memory backend is suitable for local inspection. Use a configured
persistent backend when records must survive process restarts, and set
retention appropriate to the data being captured.

Replay queries go to the management API:

```bash
curl -sS 'http://localhost:8080/api/v1/observability/replays?limit=20' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${VSR_MGMT_TOKEN}"
```

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/observability/replays` | List and filter records |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/observability/replays/{id}` | Read one record |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/observability/replays/aggregate` | Aggregate routing and cost metadata |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/observability/replays/trajectory?session_id=...&recipe=...` | Reconstruct one recipe's session trajectory |

List and aggregate requests accept filters such as `recipe`, `decision`,
`model`, `session_id`, `cache_status`, and `search`. Pagination uses `limit`
and `offset`; `limit` is capped at 100. `showDetails=true` requests large body
fields, so use it only when those fields are needed.

Trajectory queries use the exact recipe name. Omitting `recipe` is supported
only when the session's records belong to one recipe; an ambiguous session
returns `400`. An explicit empty `recipe=` selects older, unscoped records.
The response includes each request's route, latency, and lifecycle, including
multiple requests at the same turn index.

Records, trajectory routes, and messages include `conversation_id` when an
explicit conversation identity is available. Messages are grouped by conversation
and turn, so separate conversations in one session can each start at turn zero.
Insights shows their boundaries and complete IDs.

Dashboard Insights shows these routes alongside recorded signals, projections,
candidate scores, and session-switch reasons. In `observe` mode, candidate and
hold explanations describe what protection would have done; the selected model
and route history still describe actual dispatch. Protection's `candidate_models`
lists eligible models independently of their scores; an unrecorded score appears
as `—`, while a recorded zero remains zero. Missing identity or evidence
is displayed explicitly. A recipe's `data_policy.replay: false` prevents its
requests from appearing in Replay, including rejected requests.

When bearer authentication is enabled, replay callers need `replay.read`.
Prompt, response, tool, and other sensitive details remain redacted unless the
principal also has `replay.detail`. Treat replay storage as potentially
sensitive even when the API normally returns a redacted view.

Replay lifecycle values describe what the recorder observed:

- `in_progress`: no terminal response frame has been recorded yet.
- `completed`: the response finished normally.
- `failed`: routing or the upstream response failed.
- `aborted`: the stream ended without a valid terminal frame, for example
  after a disconnect or timeout.

An HTTP `200` response header alone does not make a streaming record
`completed`.

## Which port should I use?

| Task | Surface |
| --- | --- |
| Send model traffic | Configured Envoy listener; `8899` in the standard local stack |
| List public models | `GET /v1/models` on the inference listener |
| Check health or readiness | Management API on `8080` |
| Read or change configuration | Management API on `8080` |
| Inspect replay records | Management API on `8080` |
| Manage Router-owned files or vector stores | Management API on `8080` under `/api/v1/storage/*` |

Do not expose the management port as a substitute for the public inference
listener. Its endpoints can reveal configuration and operational data or make
state-changing requests.
