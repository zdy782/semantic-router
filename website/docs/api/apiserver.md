# Router management API

The router management API provides health, classification, configuration,
storage, cache, compression, and replay operations. It listens on port `8080`
by default and the local stack binds it to `127.0.0.1`.

For model traffic, use the configured Envoy listener described in
[Router API](./router).

## Start with the live schema

The running router generates its endpoint discovery and OpenAPI document from
the routes it has registered. Use these pages for registered methods, path and
query parameters, request-body fields, access policy, and response media:

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /api/v1` | Endpoint discovery with permission and sensitivity metadata |
| `GET /openapi.json` | Complete OpenAPI 3.0 document |
| `GET /openapi.json?path=...&method=...` | One valid path or operation document |
| `GET /docs` | Interactive Swagger UI |

This page groups the API by user task. The live OpenAPI document is the
field-level source of truth for the version you are running.

```bash
curl -sS http://localhost:8080/health
curl -sS http://localhost:8080/openapi.json
curl -sS 'http://localhost:8080/openapi.json?path=/api/v1/config&method=PATCH'
```

Agents should call these Router endpoints directly; the Dashboard is not part
of the discovery path. The Website also renders the generated contract in the
[searchable OpenAPI reference](./openapi).

## Access and authentication

The local CLI keeps the management port on loopback. For a remote router,
prefer a private network or an SSH tunnel instead of publishing the port:

```bash
ssh -N -L 8080:127.0.0.1:8080 router-host
```

Management authentication is disabled unless configured. To require bearer
tokens, set `global.services.management_api.auth.mode: bearer` and define roles
and token sources in the management API configuration. Then send:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

`GET /health` remains public. Other routes enforce their assigned permission
when bearer authentication is enabled. Configuration and replay responses can
also redact sensitive fields unless the principal has the corresponding detail
permission.

## Health and discovery

| Method | Path | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/health` | Process liveness |
| `GET` | `/ready` | Whether startup has completed |
| `GET` | `/startup-status` | Startup and model-download progress |
| `GET` | `/api/v1` | Registered endpoint discovery |
| `GET` | `/openapi.json` | Generated OpenAPI schema, optionally narrowed by exact `path` and `method` |
| `GET` | `/docs` | Swagger UI |

Use `/health` for liveness and `/ready` for readiness. During model download or
runtime preparation, a process can be healthy while `/ready` still returns
`503`.

## Inspect signals without an inference call

The classification endpoints are useful when tuning signals or diagnosing why
a decision did not match. They do not call a generation backend.

```bash
curl -sS http://localhost:8080/api/v1/diagnostics/classify/intent \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"text":"Write a Python function that merges two sorted lists."}'
```

| Method | Path | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/diagnostics/classify/intent` | Evaluate intent/domain routing |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/diagnostics/classify/pii` | Detect configured PII types |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/diagnostics/classify/security` | Evaluate jailbreak and security classification |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/diagnostics/classify/fact-check` | Decide whether text needs fact checking |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/diagnostics/classify/user-feedback` | Classify user feedback |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/diagnostics/classify/combined` | Run intent, PII, and security classification |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/diagnostics/classify/batch` | Run a selected classifier over a batch |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/routing/preview` | Evaluate all configured signals |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/diagnostics/nli` | Evaluate a premise/hypothesis pair |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/diagnostics/embeddings` | Generate configured text or image embeddings |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/diagnostics/similarity` | Compare a text pair |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/diagnostics/similarity/batch` | Run batch similarity matching |

Names, scores, and matched rules depend on the active recipe. Use the live
schema for each endpoint's supported input forms.

When the matched decision uses `fast_response`, Preview reports
`selection_status: not_required` and `selection_method: fast_response`, with no
`selected_model`. This immediate response needs no model assignment or candidate
capability/context admission. The client-facing response model identifier does
not imply that a generation backend was selected or called.

Guard and PII report `input_limit` in `signal_errors` when input exceeds their
configured inference budget. Check the effective model and deployment limits
before retrying. Other inference failures retain their bounded signal error
codes; the configured unknown-signal policy determines the route outcome.

## Inspect models and metrics

| Method | Path | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/inventory/models` | Loaded model inventory |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/inventory/classifier` | Classifier configuration and status |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/inventory/embedding-models` | Loaded embedding models |
| `GET` | `/v1/models` | OpenAI-compatible model list |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/observability/classification-metrics` | Classification counters and timing |

Secrets in classifier information are redacted unless the caller has
`secret_view`.

## Read and change router configuration

Read the current canonical document and its `ETag` before making a change:

```bash
curl -i http://localhost:8080/api/v1/config \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${VSR_MGMT_TOKEN}"
```

| Method | Path | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/config` | Read the active canonical configuration |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/config/validate` | Validate and normalize without writing |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/config/plan` | Plan the exact candidate and return the current/candidate ETags without writing |
| `PATCH` | `/api/v1/config` | Merge, validate, persist, and hot-reload an update |
| `PUT` | `/api/v1/config` | Replace, validate, persist, and hot-reload the document |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/config/versions` | List configuration backups |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/config/rollback` | Restore a backup |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/config/hash` | Compare persisted, generated, and active hashes |

Recipe operations use the same canonical document:

| Method | Path | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/config/recipes` | List default and named recipes and their entrypoints |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/config/recipes/validate` | Validate a recipe mutation without applying it |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/config/recipes/{name}` | Read one recipe |
| `PUT` | `/api/v1/config/recipes/{name}` | Create or replace one recipe |
| `DELETE` | `/api/v1/config/recipes/{name}` | Delete an unreferenced named recipe |

Every config mutation, including rollback and Recipe `PUT`/`DELETE`, requires
the exact current `ETag` in `If-Match`. The Router does not accept unguarded
writes. A mutation response and `GET /api/v1/config/hash` use the same explicit
runtime identity fields: `source_config_hash`, `generated_runtime_hash`,
`active_runtime_hash`, and `activation_status`. Config mutations validate,
create a backup, and trigger reload; an active config still does not prove that
upstream model backends are healthy. Check `/ready` and send a representative
request after a change.

## Manage knowledge bases and stored data

Knowledge-base configuration:

| Method | Path | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET`, `POST` | `/api/v1/storage/knowledge-bases` | List or create managed knowledge bases |
| `GET`, `PUT`, `DELETE` | `/api/v1/storage/knowledge-bases/{name}` | Read, update, or delete one knowledge base |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/storage/knowledge-bases/{name}/map/metadata` | Read generated map metadata |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/storage/knowledge-bases/{name}/map/data.ndjson` | Stream map data as NDJSON |

In a router process, create, update, and delete persist a candidate and return
`202` with `activation_status: pending` and `generated_runtime_hash` while the
replacement generation prepares. Poll `/api/v1/config/hash` until
`active_runtime_hash` matches that candidate. A second KB mutation while pending
returns `409` with `CONFIG_ACTIVATION_PENDING` and does not overwrite it.
Updates use independent asset revision paths; deletion removes the candidate
config entry while retaining files needed by old and rollback generations.
Old revisions require offline cleanup after their configuration references
have been retired. Standalone API servers report `activation_status: unknown`
with their normal success status because no router generation registry is present.

Router-managed storage and memory:

| Resource | Base path | Operations |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Long-term memory | `/api/v1/storage/memories` | List and delete by scope; read or delete by id |
| Vector stores | `/api/v1/storage/vector-stores` | Create, list, read, update, delete, and search |
| Vector-store files | `/api/v1/storage/vector-stores/{id}/files` | Attach, list, inspect, and detach files |
| Files | `/api/v1/storage/files` | Upload, list, inspect, download, and delete |

These routes return `503` when their required service is unavailable. File
upload uses multipart form data and accepts documents (`.txt`, `.md`, `.json`,
`.csv`, `.html`) for vector-store ingestion; upload an image (`.png`, `.jpg`,
`.jpeg`, `.gif`, `.webp`) with `purpose=vision` to reference it from a Response
API `input_image` part by `file_id`. Consult the live schema for limits and
fields. They exist only on the management listener. `/v1/files` and
`/v1/vector_stores` are not inference-listener aliases and are not registered
by the Router API.

## Operate the response cache

Response-cache endpoints are separate from inference-time cache lookup. They
let operators inspect the backend, test a candidate configuration, and perform
audited invalidation.

| Method | Path | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/response-cache/capabilities` | Backend capabilities |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/response-cache/health` | Backend health |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/response-cache/stats` | Redacted statistics |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/response-cache/audit` | Redacted mutation audit entries |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/response-cache/test` | Validate and probe a candidate configuration |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/response-cache/invalidate` | Dry-run or invalidate a scoped partition |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/response-cache/flush` | Advance a scoped or global cache epoch |

Prefer scoped invalidation and a dry run before a destructive cache mutation.
Bearer roles distinguish read, invalidate, and broader cache-management
permissions.

## Inspect context compression

| Method | Path | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/context-compression/capabilities` | Runtime capabilities |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/context-compression/health` | Runtime health |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/context-compression/stats` | Redacted statistics |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/context-compression/preview` | Preview compression without persistence |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/context-compression/recovery/invalidate` | Invalidate a trusted recovery scope |

Use `preview` to evaluate what would be retained before enabling compression on
important traffic.

## Inspect replay and submit outcomes

Router Replay is management-only. Its query endpoints and redaction model are
described in [Router API](./router#router-replay).

Router Learning can ingest an outcome linked to an owned replay record:

```bash
curl -sS http://localhost:8080/api/v1/observability/outcomes \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${VSR_MGMT_TOKEN}" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Idempotency-Key: feedback-123' \
  -d '{
    "replay_id": "replay_...",
    "target": "model",
    "verdict": "good_fit",
    "score": 0.9
  }'
```

`replay_id`, `target`, and `verdict` are required. The authenticated principal,
not the optional `source` body field, determines provenance. Use a stable
`Idempotency-Key` when a client may retry. Ingestion also requires an active
Router Learning runtime and the `learning.ingest` permission when bearer auth
is enabled.

## API boundaries

- The management API is an operational surface, not the public inference
  gateway.
- Endpoint availability can depend on compiled features and enabled services.
- The OpenAPI document describes shape, not the behavior of a particular
  model, store, or external backend.
- Keep bearer tokens out of URLs and logs. Give automation only the permissions
  it needs.
