# Signal

## Overview

Signals turn request facts into names that routing decisions can reuse. For
example, a signal can identify a long prompt, a tool-heavy conversation, a
language, or a likely prompt-injection attempt. A decision then chooses what to
do when that signal matches.

Use [Projections](../projection/overview) when you need to combine several
signals into a score, partition, or routing band before a decision runs.

## Key Advantages

- Reuses one detector across multiple decisions.
- Keeps detection logic separate from route outcomes.
- Lets one route combine lexical, policy, semantic, and safety inputs.
- Makes config reviews easier because signal names become stable policy building blocks.

## What Problem Does It Solve?

Without a signal layer, every decision has to inline its own detection logic. That creates duplication, makes route policies harder to audit, and mixes "what did we detect?" with "what should we do?".

Signals solve that by turning request understanding into a named catalog that the rest of the routing graph can compose.

## When to Use

Use signals when:

- more than one route needs the same detector
- you want to mix different detection methods in one decision tree
- you need a clean boundary between detection, decision logic, algorithms, and plugins
- you want to tune detection without rewriting route outcomes

## Configuration

In canonical v0.3 YAML, signals live under `routing.signals`:

```yaml
routing:
  signals:
    keywords:
      - name: urgent_keywords
        operator: OR
        keywords: ["urgent", "asap"]
    embeddings:
      - name: technical_support
        threshold: 0.75
        candidates: ["installation guide", "troubleshooting steps"]
      - name: account_management
        threshold: 0.72
        candidates: ["billing information", "subscription management"]
  projections:
    partitions:
      - name: support_intents
        semantics: exclusive
        temperature: 0.3
        members: [technical_support, account_management]
        default: technical_support
    scores:
      - name: request_difficulty
        method: weighted_sum
        inputs:
          - type: embedding
            name: technical_support
            weight: 0.18
            value_source: confidence
    mappings:
      - name: request_band
        source: request_difficulty
        method: threshold_bands
        outputs:
          - name: support_escalated
            gte: 0.25
```

Choose a signal by the kind of fact you need to detect.

### Heuristic Signals

These signals use explicit rules, request shape, identity, or lightweight
detectors. They do not require a general-purpose classifier model.

| Signal | Use it to |
| ------ | --------- |
| [Authz](./heuristic/authz) | route from trusted identity, role, or tenant policy |
| [Conversation](./heuristic/conversation) | detect multi-turn, tool-heavy, or agentic request structure |
| [Context](./heuristic/context) | route by effective context-window needs |
| [Event](./heuristic/event) | detect structured events by type, severity, action code, or urgency |
| [Input Modality](./heuristic/input-modality) | detect which input modalities (text, image, audio, video) are present |
| [Keyword](./heuristic/keyword) | match explicit words, phrases, BM25 terms, or n-grams |
| [Language](./heuristic/language) | route by detected request language |
| [Metadata](./heuristic/metadata) | use bounded, caller-provided application hints |
| [Structure](./heuristic/structure) | detect counts, density, and ordered markers in a prompt |

### Learned Signals

These signals use embeddings, classifiers, or configured detector models. Check
each page's data-handling notes before choosing a remote provider.

| Signal | Use it to |
| ------ | --------- |
| [Classifier](./learned/classifier) | expose labels from a custom local classifier or external LLM |
| [Complexity](./learned/complexity) | estimate easy, medium, or hard reasoning traffic |
| [Domain](./learned/domain) | classify the request topic |
| [Embedding](./learned/embedding) | match semantic intent from representative examples |
| [Modality](./learned/modality) | classify text, image-generation, or mixed output intent |
| [Fact Check](./learned/fact-check) | detect prompts that may need evidence verification |
| [Hallucination](./learned/hallucination) | check the model's answer against the grounding context it was given |
| [Jailbreak](./learned/jailbreak) | detect prompt-injection or jailbreak attempts |
| [Safety](./learned/safety) | detect unsafe content and optional risk categories |
| [PII](./learned/pii) | detect sensitive personal data |
| [Preference](./learned/preference) | infer response-style preferences |
| [Reask](./learned/reask) | detect a repeated question in recent conversation history |
| [Knowledge Base](./learned/kb) | match labels or groups from a reusable exemplar set |
| [User Feedback](./learned/user-feedback) | detect correction, dissatisfaction, or escalation feedback |

Keep these rules in mind:

- keep signals named and reusable
- keep signals detection-only; routing outcomes belong in `decision/`
- keep partitions and derived routing bands in `routing.projections`, not back inside `routing.signals`
- keep model choice separate; that belongs in `algorithm/`
- keep route-side behavior separate; that belongs in `plugin/`

## Next Steps

- Read [Projections](../projection/overview) when you need `PROJECTION partition`, weighted score aggregation, or named routing bands.
- Start from [`config/config.yaml`](https://github.com/vllm-project/semantic-router/blob/main/config/config.yaml) for the exhaustive public contract.
- See the `balance` recipe for a complete routing strategy:
  - [`config/recipes/balance/config.yaml`](https://github.com/vllm-project/semantic-router/blob/main/config/recipes/balance/config.yaml)
  - [`config/recipes/balance/recipe.dsl`](https://github.com/vllm-project/semantic-router/blob/main/config/recipes/balance/recipe.dsl)

Signals can inspect request text, conversation history, images, caller
metadata, or trusted identity depending on the family. Learned signals may send
that data to a configured remote classifier or embedding provider. Review the
dependency and data notes on each family page before using it as a policy gate.
