# PII Signal

## Overview

`pii` detects sensitive personal data in requests. Define PII rules under
`routing.signals.pii`.

It uses the PII detector configured through
`global.model_catalog.system.pii_classifier`.

## Key Advantages

- Makes privacy-sensitive routing explicit.
- Lets decisions block, downgrade, or isolate risky traffic before it reaches a backend.
- Supports allowlists for low-risk identifier types.
- Keeps privacy policy reusable across routes and plugins.

## What Problem Does It Solve?

Without a dedicated PII signal, privacy-sensitive traffic can reach the wrong model or plugin stack before detection happens. Ad hoc filters also make policy harder to audit.

`pii` solves that by turning personal-data detection into a reusable routing input.

## When to Use

Use `pii` when:

- prompts may contain regulated or sensitive personal data
- some PII types are acceptable but others must trigger a safer route
- privacy-sensitive traffic needs different plugins or backends
- route policy depends on early PII detection

## Configuration

```yaml
routing:
  signals:
    pii:
      - name: restricted_pii
        threshold: 0.85
        include_history: true
        pii_types_allowed:
          - EMAIL_ADDRESS
        description: Sensitive prompts where only low-risk identifiers may pass through.
```

When `pii_types_allowed` is empty, any detected PII can cause the signal to match.

## Complete local scans

The implicit local Vela PII default scans each text item up to 32,768 tokens,
including special tokens. Each forward uses at most 512 tokens, with 255 content
tokens of overlap. The model tokenizer defines the windows; character estimates
and text re-tokenization at window boundaries do not determine coverage.

Native Candle and ORT preserve original UTF-8 offsets, choose one observation per
token by its surrounding context, then decode BIO entities once. Overlap does not
double-count input usage or entity confidence. This guarantees coverage of admitted
tokens, not detection accuracy or the quality of a single 32K forward.

An explicit module budget, backend, window, or recipe binding keeps its own
policy. For example, a deployment with `input: {max_tokens: 8192, overflow: reject}`
still rejects an oversized input. To request windows explicitly, use:

```yaml
global:
  model_catalog:
    modules:
      classifier:
        pii:
          use_mmbert_32k: true
          max_sequence_length: 32768  # Complete text budget, including special tokens.
          window: {size: 512, overlap: 255}
```

With a named binding, declare `input.overflow: window` and a positive
`input.max_tokens` on its deployment; that limit replaces the module budget.
The same `window` block supplies the geometry. Unsupported adapters, missing
window geometry, and limits beyond the loaded model's capacity are errors.
Window size includes the tokenizer's special tokens; overlap counts content only.

A text beyond the document limit or a failed window produces a classifier error,
not a successful partial scan. Existing `on_error` and decision `rules.on_unknown`
policies determine its routing effect. Remote backends and explicitly selected
truncation retain the partial-result behavior described below.

## Remote backend (token_spans.v1)

With no `backend`, PII detection keeps its local model. A remote PII classifier
uses the shared backend block: `model` names an entry in
`global.model_catalog.external[]` with `model_role: classification`, the
protocol is `http_classify`, and the contract is `token_spans.v1`. The service
receives `{"inputs": "<request text>"}` and answers with entity spans whose
`start`/`end` are Unicode code-point offsets into that exact string, a `label`
from the configured PII mapping, a `score` in `[0, 1]`, and the span `text`,
which must equal the slice it points at. The HuggingFace token-classification
spellings `entity_group` and `word` are accepted as aliases. A bare JSON list of
spans or an envelope `{"spans": [...], "truncated_at": n, "model": "..."}` are
both valid; the envelope's `model`, when present, must equal the catalog
entry's `llm_model_name`.

The router rejects the whole response, rather than part of it, when a span is
outside the text, overlaps itself, carries an unknown or outside label, has a
score out of range, has conflicting alias values, or when the body is not a span
list. A declared `truncated_at` keeps the spans before the cut and marks the
rest of the content as unscored. What a rejected or partial response does to a
PII rule is `on_error`: `allow` (default) treats the unread content as not
matching, `block` matches it as `classification_error`, so unverified text
cannot pass as clean.

The PII mapping cannot declare `classification_error` as an entity label.
Aliases with `B-`, `I-`, or `E-` prefixes, including stacked prefixes, are also
reserved and rejected at mapping load time in either mapping direction.

Spans returned before a declared cut are real detections under both policies. A
rule that matched on one of them stays a genuine match even when the rest of
its content was never read, so a decision using `rules.on_unknown: no_match`
still sees it; only a match that exists solely because the scan failed is
unknown to the decision engine. The detection API says the same thing with
`scan_incomplete: true` beside its entities, so `has_pii: false` after a
truncation reads as "nothing in the part that was read" rather than as a clean
scan.

```yaml
global:
  model_catalog:
    external:
      - name: pii-service
        model_role: classification
        llm_endpoint:
          address: pii-spans.default.svc
          port: 8080
        llm_model_name: pii-spans-v1
    modules:
      classifier:
        pii:
          backend:
            protocol: http_classify
            contract: token_spans.v1
            model: pii-service
            deadline_ms: 5000
          on_error: block
```

`PIIDetected`, `PIIEntities`, `MatchedPIIRules` and the masked text are the
same whether the spans came from the local model or from a remote backend;
overlapping and nested spans are merged before masking.

## Dependencies and Limitations

The PII classifier processes the prompt and optional history. It is a routing
control, not a substitute for redaction, encryption, access control, or data
loss prevention. Calibrate thresholds by entity type. See a complete example:
