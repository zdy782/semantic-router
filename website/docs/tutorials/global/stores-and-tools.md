# Stores and Tools

## Overview

This page covers the shared storage and tool blocks inside `global:`.

These settings back route-local plugins and router-wide tool behavior.

## Key Advantages

- Centralizes shared backing stores instead of repeating them per route.
- Keeps response cache, memory, retrieval, and tool catalogs consistent.
- Lets route-local plugins stay small and focused.
- Makes shared infrastructure dependencies explicit.

## What Problem Does It Solve?

Route-local plugins often depend on shared storage or tool state. If those dependencies are configured ad hoc inside each route, the system becomes inconsistent and harder to operate.

These `global:` blocks solve that by defining shared backing services once.

## When to Use

Use these blocks when:

- multiple routes depend on the same response cache or memory backend
- retrieval features need one shared vector store
- the router should expose one shared tool catalog
- backing-store configuration belongs to the whole router rather than one route

## Configuration

### Response Cache

```yaml
global:
  stores:
    response_cache:
      enabled: true
      backend_type: memory
      similarity_threshold: 0.8
      polarity_guard:
        mode: lexical          # lexical | nli | lexical+nli
        nli:
          contradiction_threshold: 0.5
```

#### Negation guard

Bi-encoder similarity cannot tell *"turn on dark mode"* from *"turn off dark
mode"*: opposite-meaning queries often score above `similarity_threshold`
while genuine paraphrases score below it, so raising the threshold does not
fix the false hit. `polarity_guard` verifies the winning candidate before the
in-memory backend serves it:

- `lexical` (default): the model-free tier that catches negation cues and
  known antonym swaps. It is always on and needs no model.
- `nli` / `lexical+nli`: additionally runs the router's NLI model once per
  lookup on the single best candidate and rejects the hit when the
  contradiction probability exceeds `nli.contradiction_threshold`. The tier
  reuses the hallucination explainer
  (`global.model_catalog.modules.hallucination_mitigation.explainer`, by default
  `tasksource/ModernBERT-base-nli`); the native binding holds one NLI model, so
  the guard cannot bind a different one. Config loading fails when an NLI mode
  is selected without that model. Expect roughly 70 ms per verified hit on CPU;
  a cache hit still saves a full generation. If the model errors at lookup
  time the guard fails open: the hit is served and a
  `cache_polarity_nli_skipped` warning is logged.

Rejections are logged as `cache_negation_reject` with `tier: nli`, count as
misses, and still surface the rejected score on `x-vsr-cache-similarity`. Remote
and hybrid cache backends do not run the guard.

### Memory

The memory store supports three backends: `milvus` (default), `valkey`, and `qdrant`.

**Milvus backend** (default):

```yaml
global:
  stores:
    memory:
      enabled: true
      milvus:
        address: milvus:19530
        collection: agentic_memory
        dimension: 384
```

**Valkey backend** (requires Valkey with Search module):

```yaml
global:
  stores:
    memory:
      enabled: true
      backend: valkey
      valkey:
        host: valkey
        port: 6379
        dimension: 384
        collection_prefix: "mem:"
        index_name: mem_idx
        metric_type: COSINE
```

**Qdrant backend**:

```yaml
global:
  stores:
    memory:
      enabled: true
      backend: qdrant
      qdrant:
        host: qdrant
        port: 6334
        collection: agentic_memory
        dimension: 384
      embedding_model: bert
      default_retrieval_limit: 5
      default_similarity_threshold: 0.70
```

- [Qdrant](../../installation/qdrant) — Docker, Kubernetes, config reference, tuning, and troubleshooting
- `config/runtime/memory/` for backend-specific configuration references

When an external model with `model_role: memory_rewrite` is configured, its
`max_response_bytes` limits each query-rewrite response. An omitted or
non-positive value uses the 1 MiB default.

### Vector Store

```yaml
global:
  stores:
    vector_store:
      enabled: true
      backend_type: milvus
      metadata_store: postgres
```

Supported backends: `memory`, `milvus`, `llama_stack`, `valkey`, `qdrant`.

`metadata_store` controls the registry for vector-store and uploaded-file
metadata. Use `postgres` for restart-safe local or production-like stacks; the
CLI local runtime will provision Postgres and fill `metadata_postgres` connection
defaults when `metadata_store: postgres` is set. Use `memory` only for ephemeral
local experiments because store and file metadata is lost on router restart.

With local `mmbert` embeddings, including Vela Embedding, each new vector store
records the identity of the representation that created its vectors. After a
model or dimension change, existing stores remain visible and their uploaded
files are retained. Searching or attaching files to an incompatible or untagged
store returns `409 EMBEDDING_REINDEX_REQUIRED`. Create a new vector store and
reattach the original uploaded file IDs to generate compatible vectors. Client
metadata cannot replace the router-owned `_router_embedding_identity` field.

The same check applies to request-time RAG and cached retrieval results. The
`llama_stack` backend embeds search queries remotely, so it cannot currently be
combined with identity-bound local `mmbert` document embeddings. Use `memory`,
`milvus`, `valkey`, or `qdrant` for that configuration. Remote provider identity
verification is a separate capability.

### Tools

```yaml
global:
  integrations:
    tools:
      enabled: true
      top_k: 3
      tools_db_path: config/runtime/tools/tools_db.json
```

## Data and Security

- Cache, memory, and vector stores can contain prompts, responses, embeddings,
  retrieved documents, or extracted memories. Configure authentication,
  encryption, retention, and tenant/user scope for the selected backend.
- Embedding dimensions must match existing collections. Rebuild or migrate an
  index when the embedding model or dimension changes.
- Tool retrieval controls what is shown to a model; it does not authorize tool
  execution. Enforce permissions at the tool service.
