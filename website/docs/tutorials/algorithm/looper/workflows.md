# Router Flow

## Overview

`workflows` runs a bounded, multi-step Router Flow behind one
OpenAI-compatible model name.

The runtime also supports a direct Flow model slug through
`global.integrations.looper.flow.model_names`. The built-in default is
`vllm-sr/flow`. Direct Flow calls evaluate only decisions with
`algorithm.type=workflows`; they do not silently fall back to normal single-model
routes.

## Key Advantages

- Exposes a multi-step agent workflow as one model name: `vllm-sr/flow`.
- Keeps worker boundaries explicit: dynamic planners may only use the decision's
  `modelRefs`.
- Supports both static role plans and dynamic planner-generated workflows.
- Records a Flow trace with plan, worker steps, responses, failed models, and
  usage.

## What Problem Does It Solve?

Some requests need orchestration rather than a one-step route decision: split the
task, ask multiple workers for targeted work, verify or reconcile the outputs,
and return one final answer through the same chat completions API. `workflows`
makes that orchestration part of Router policy while keeping the public model
surface as small as `vllm-sr/flow`.

## When to Use

- A route should expose a single model name but run a bounded micro-agent flow.
- The worker pool should come from the decision's `modelRefs`.
- You want static low-latency templates for predictable tasks.
- You want dynamic planner-generated workflows for harder reasoning, coding, or
  verification tasks.

## Configuration

Register the direct model slug:

```yaml
global:
  integrations:
    looper:
      endpoint: http://localhost:8899/v1/chat/completions
      max_response_bytes_mb: 32 # optional; caps a single upstream response body (default 32 MiB)
      flow:
        model_names:
          - vllm-sr/flow
        state:
          store_backend: file
          ttl_seconds: 1800
          file:
            directory: .vllm-sr/flow-state
```

Configure a dynamic Flow decision:

```yaml
routing:
  decisions:
    - name: coding_flow
      description: Coordinate coding work through planned worker steps.
      priority: 100
      output_contract: Preserve any explicit output format exactly.
      modelRefs:
        - model: openrouter/gemini-pro
        - model: openrouter/deepseek
        - model: qwen/qwen3.6-rocm
      algorithm:
        type: workflows
        workflows:
          mode: dynamic
          planner:
            model: qwen-coordinator
            max_completion_tokens: 2048
          max_steps: 6
          max_parallel: 3
          round_timeout_seconds: 90
          min_successful_responses: 2
          on_error: skip
```

`output_contract` is decision-scoped prompt text. Use it for benchmark or
application format requirements that should apply across static Flow, dynamic
Flow, Fusion, and ReMoM instead of hard-coding task-specific prompts into an
algorithm. Use `output_contract_spec` for typed router-executable normalization
and post-processing such as choice extraction, terminal-action JSON
normalization, or reference dereferencing. Extraction defaults to exact
`content` matching; use `extract.sources` or `extract.mode: json_object` only
when the decision explicitly permits a wider parser.

The planner model generates the control plan. Omit `planner.model` to use the
first assigned worker, in declared order, that is eligible for the complete
planner request, including JSON output and its output/context budget. This scan
makes no model calls. An explicit planner override keeps that target and must
pass the same stage checks; it is not replaced by another model on failure.
If no eligible planner exists, the request fails closed. An explicit planner
may be a separately configured helper outside the worker `modelRefs`, but must
still have an operator-assigned backend. Worker calls remain constrained to
`modelRefs`; the executor rejects a plan that names a worker outside that list.
Planner selection does not reduce a configured minimum of distinct successful
workers.

Static mode uses an explicit role plan. Each role model must be in the
decision's `modelRefs`.

```yaml
routing:
  decisions:
    - name: static_flow
      description: Coordinate a fixed sequence of worker roles.
      priority: 100
      modelRefs:
        - model: qwen-worker
        - model: deepseek-worker
      algorithm:
        type: workflows
        workflows:
          mode: static
          roles:
            - name: thinker
              models: [qwen-worker]
            - name: worker
              models: [deepseek-worker]
            - name: verifier
              models: [qwen-worker]
          final:
            model: qwen-worker
          max_steps: 3
          max_parallel: 1
          round_timeout_seconds: 90
          on_error: skip
```

| `state.ttl_seconds` | int | `1800` | TTL for pending tool-call workflow state |
| `mode` | string | `static` | `static` role execution or `dynamic` planner-generated execution |
| `template` | string | `micro_agent` | Static workflow template name |
| `roles` | list[object] | required for static | Ordered static roles, each with `name`, `models`, optional `prompt`, and optional `access_list` of earlier role ids or agent ids |
| `final.model` | string | first worker response | Optional static final synthesis model from `modelRefs` |
| `final.prompt` | string | built-in synthesis prompt | Optional static final synthesis instruction |
| `planner.model` | string | first eligible assigned worker | Optional explicit model used to generate the workflow plan |
| `planner.max_completion_tokens` | int | `2048` | Max completion tokens for the planner JSON plan only |
| `minimum_candidates` | int | unset | Minimum distinct decision `modelRefs` required after Recipe materialization and context eligibility filtering |

| `max_parallel` | int | `2` | Maximum worker models per step |
| `max_completion_tokens` | int | request default | Max completion tokens for worker and final synthesis calls |
| `round_timeout_seconds` | int | unset | Maximum seconds to wait for each workflow step or final synthesis |

Every static role and every planner-generated step must contain at least
`min_successful_responses` Models. A plan that cannot satisfy its configured
quorum is rejected instead of running with a silently reduced quorum.

## Tool And Function Calling

Router Flow preserves the normal OpenAI-compatible tool-calling contract for
clients. Send `tools` or legacy `functions` on the `vllm-sr/flow` request as you
would for a single model.

When a worker or the final synthesizer returns `tool_calls`, Flow:

1. stores the pending workflow state, including plan, completed step outputs,
   current agent request, and that agent's private tool trajectory;
2. rewrites each `tool_call_id` with a Flow state prefix and returns the tool
   call to the client;
3. consumes the state on the next request when the client sends matching
   trailing `tool` messages;
4. routes those tool results back to the exact worker or final agent that
   requested them, without replaying unrelated workers;
5. continues that agent's tool loop until it produces content, then resumes the
   remaining workflow.

Each worker has its own message history. A later step's `access_list` exposes
only prior step or prior agent outputs, not another worker's raw tool calls or
tool-result trajectory. Omitting `access_list` exposes all earlier step outputs;
setting it to `[]` isolates the step from prior outputs. Use a role id such as
`solver` to expose all outputs from that role, or an agent id such as
`solver:1:deepseek-worker` to expose only one worker from a parallel role. The
same agent id is emitted as `flow.steps[].responses[].agent_id` when
`include_intermediate_responses` is enabled.

For local single-process development, `memory` is enough. For local restarts use
`file`. For multi-replica deployments, use `redis` so a tool-result turn can be
claimed by whichever router instance receives it.

## Request

```json
{
  "model": "vllm-sr/flow",
  "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Debug this flaky test and propose a patch."}]
}
```

## Design Notes

Router Flow intentionally keeps the user-facing API small. The decision's
`modelRefs` are the worker pool. `algorithm.workflows` describes how to
orchestrate that pool, not a second model catalog.

Planner and worker models receive request-derived content according to the
workflow plan. Tool-call state can be persisted in memory, files, or Redis;
choose a backend, TTL, authentication, and encryption appropriate for that
content. See a complete example:
[`config/fragments/algorithm/looper/workflows.yaml`](https://github.com/vllm-project/semantic-router/blob/main/config/fragments/algorithm/looper/workflows.yaml).
