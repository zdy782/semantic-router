# Multi Factor

## Overview

`multi_factor` chooses one candidate from quality, latency, cost, and load. Hard
eligibility rules run first; the surviving candidates are then compared with a
weighted or lexicographic objective.

| Factor | Source | Direction |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Quality | Versioned Overall, capability, or operator index | Higher is better |
| Latency | Observed TTFT or TPOT at the selected percentile | Lower is better |
| Cost | Input/output pricing applied to this request's token budget | Lower is better |
| Load | Current in-flight requests in this Router process | Lower is better |

Quality is resolved for the candidate's exact reasoning effort. A score from a
different effort is never borrowed.

Set `latency_metric: ttft` to favor a fast first token, or `tpot` to favor fast
streaming after generation starts. With either setting, a missing measurement
stays unknown; the other metric is never substituted. If no candidate has that
measurement yet, lexicographic selection continues to the next priority.
Omitting the setting preserves the existing TPOT-then-TTFT behavior.

## What Problem Does It Solve?

A model pool often contains a stronger model, a cheaper model, and a faster
model. This selector keeps eligibility explicit and makes that trade-off one
auditable decision policy.

## When to Use

Use `multi_factor` when a decision has at least two candidate models and must
optimize a quality/latency/cost/load trade-off. Use `static` when order alone is
the policy, or `latency_aware` when latency is the only selection signal.

## Configuration

### Balanced

The default `weighted` strategy min-max normalizes each available factor over
the surviving pool and computes:

$$
S(m)=w_Q\hat Q(m)+w_T(1-\hat T(m))+w_C(1-\hat C(m))+w_L(1-\hat L(m))
$$

```yaml
algorithm:
  type: multi_factor
  multi_factor:
    objective:
      strategy: weighted
    quality:
      index: vllm-sr/coding@1.0.0
      on_missing: exclude
      min_coverage: 1.0
    weights:
      quality: 0.4
      latency: 0.2
      cost: 0.2
      load: 0.2
```

Weights are normalized to sum to one. If every configured weight is zero, the
selector recovers to equal weights.

### Accuracy-first

`lexicographic` applies priorities in order. Each stage keeps candidates within
the declared relative tolerance of the best observed value, then passes that
band to the next stage.

Only candidates surviving every priority remain eligible for later adaptation,
session protection, and dispatch. These steps cannot restore a model excluded
by an earlier quality or cost band. Recorded scores may still include excluded
models to explain the selection.

```yaml
algorithm:
  type: multi_factor
  multi_factor:
    objective:
      strategy: lexicographic
      priorities:
        - {factor: quality, tolerance: 0.03}
        - {factor: cost, tolerance: 0.05}
        - {factor: latency, tolerance: 0.05}
    quality:
      index: vllm-sr/intelligence@1.0.0
      on_missing: exclude
      min_coverage: 1.0
```

This keeps models within 3% of the best quality score, then chooses the cheaper
and faster candidate inside that band.

### Cost-first with a quality floor

```yaml
algorithm:
  type: multi_factor
  multi_factor:
    quality:
      index: vllm-sr/intelligence@1.0.0
      on_missing: exclude
      min_coverage: 1.0
      min_score: 65
    objective:
      strategy: lexicographic
      priorities:
        - {factor: cost, tolerance: 0.05}
        - {factor: quality, tolerance: 0.03}
        - {factor: latency, tolerance: 0.05}
```

The quality floor excludes models below 65 before optimization. The objective
then keeps the models within 5% of the cheapest estimate and chooses the best
quality inside that cost band.

`weights` cannot be combined with a lexicographic objective. A priority factor
may appear only once.

## Quality eligibility and missing data

```yaml
quality:
  index: acme/clinical-quality@1.0.0
  on_missing: exclude
  min_coverage: 0.5
  min_score: 60
```

- `index` selects a versioned built-in or operator index.
- `min_coverage` applies after the index's own missing-data policy. It can make a
  route stricter than the index definition.
- `min_score` is a hard floor on the index's declared scale and requires
  `on_missing: exclude`.
- `exclude` removes a candidate without qualifying exact-effort evidence.
- `disable_quality` keeps the pool, but one missing candidate disables quality
  for the entire comparison. It never changes weights for only one model.

See [Open Intelligence Index](../../../benchmarking/open-intelligence-index) for
the built-in hierarchy and [Custom evaluations](../../../benchmarking/custom-evaluations)
for operator-defined evidence.

## Cost and SLOs

Input cost is calculated from the request's pre-routing token estimate. Output
cost uses `max_output_tokens` when the caller supplies it. If neither is known,
the selector falls back to the configured per-million-token rates. This same
request mix is used for the cost factor, `max_cost_per_1m`, and the `cheapest`
fallback.

```yaml
multi_factor:
  slo:
    max_tpot_ms: 200
    max_ttft_ms: 800
    max_cost_per_1m: 5.0
    max_inflight: 50
  latency_percentile: 95
  on_no_candidates: cheapest
```

SLO ceilings are enforced only when the corresponding observation is available.
If every candidate is excluded, `on_no_candidates` chooses `cheapest`, `first`,
or `fail`. `fail` is a strict policy: the Router returns HTTP 503 and never
substitutes the first configured candidate. Eval dry-runs report the selection
as unavailable for the same request.

## Parameters

| `objective.priorities[].factor` | — | `quality`, `latency`, `cost`, or `load` |
| `objective.priorities[].tolerance` | `0` | Relative band from the best value, from 0 to 1 |
| `quality.index` | Catalog default | Versioned quality index |
| `quality.on_missing` | `exclude` when explicit | `exclude` or pool-wide `disable_quality` |
| `quality.min_coverage` | Index policy | Minimum admitted evidence coverage, from 0 to 1 |
| `quality.min_score` | Off | Hard quality floor on the index scale |
| `weights.*` | `0.25` | Balanced quality, latency, cost, and load weights |
| `latency_percentile` | `95` | Observed latency percentile, from 1 to 100 |
| `latency_metric` | TPOT, then TTFT | Compare `ttft` or `tpot` consistently across candidates |
| `on_no_candidates` | `cheapest` | `cheapest`, `first`, or `fail` |

Latency and load observations are local to each Router process. Replicas may
therefore make different choices. Use shared telemetry or an infrastructure
router when fleet-global capacity is required.
