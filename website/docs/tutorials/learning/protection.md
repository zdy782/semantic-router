# Protection

## Overview

Protection keeps agent conversations stable without making continuity a
semantic route. Each request still routes through normal decisions first. After
adaptation proposes a model, protection decides whether to hold the current
model, allow the switch, or perform a bounded rescue switch.

## Key Advantages

- Keeps model choices stable inside agent conversations or whole sessions.
- Protects prefix cache, tool-loop continuity, and handoff cost.
- Suppresses random exploration during protocol-sensitive steps.
- Still permits deterministic switches and bounded rescue when evidence is
  strong enough.
- Lets sensitive decisions bypass protection through decision-local controls.

## What Problem Does It Solve?

Agent requests are not independent. Tool calls, provider state, prefix cache,
and user-visible continuity can make unnecessary model switches expensive or
confusing. Protection gives the router a scoped stability guard without turning
session continuity into a semantic decision rule.

## When to Use

- A conversation should keep using the same model unless a switch is worth the
  stability cost.
- A full session should remain stable across multiple user-initiated runs.
- Tool-loop or protocol state makes random exploration unsafe.
- A weaker protected model should still be escapable through bounded rescue.

## Configuration

```yaml
global:
  router:
    learning:
      enabled: true
      adaptation:
        enabled: false
      protection:
        enabled: true
        scope: conversation
        identity:
          headers:
            session: x-session-id
            conversation: x-conversation-id
        tuning:
          idle_timeout_seconds: 300
          min_turns_before_switch: 1
          switch_margin: 0.05
          stability_weight: 1.0
```

This enables protection independently of online model-choice adaptation. Both
components otherwise default to enabled when the master switch is enabled.

## Scopes

| Scope | What is protected | What can re-route |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `conversation` | Turns sharing one `x-conversation-id`. | A new `x-conversation-id` in the same `x-session-id`. |
| `session` | Turns sharing one `x-session-id`. | Idle timeout or a decision with `adaptations.mode: bypass`. |

Use `conversation` when each agent run should be independently routed. Use
`session` when one session-level model choice should remain stable across
multiple user-initiated runs. In `conversation` scope, a changed decision resets
minimum-turn and continuity-cost preferences. In `session` scope, a changed
decision or conversation alone does not release an eligible current model;
idle timeout, bypass, candidate exclusion, or qualified rescue can release it.
Neither scope can retain a previous model outside the admitted candidate set.

If the configured identity headers are missing, protection fails open and
records diagnostics instead of failing the request.

## Guards

Protection has two guard points:

- **preflight** suppresses stochastic sampling during tool/protocol/routine
  continuation steps.
- **switch guard** accepts or rejects adaptation's proposed model using cache,
  handoff, tool-loop, session, and switch-history cost.

The switch rule is:

```text
switch if proposal_gain >= switch_margin + stability_weight * switch_cost
```

Protection can also allow a deterministic `rescue_switch` after repeated
backend failures or replay-linked outcomes identify the current model as
underpowered. With protection identity present, backend `429` and `5xx`
responses supply failure observations even when adaptation is disabled; this
does not enable adaptive model choice or quality updates. A correction or
retry prompt alone is not an owned model outcome, though its signals can change
the matched decision. Rescue requires another eligible proposal and sufficient
evidence; it is not immediate backend failover.

Rescue is limited to eligible models at a portable turn boundary. It cannot
override an active tool-loop lock or a nonportable-context lock. Minimum-turn
and session-continuity preferences may yield to rescue when those hard
boundaries are absent. Adaptation and protection also preserve any candidate
restrictions imposed by the decision's selector, including lexicographic bands.

With protection in `apply` mode and the configured identity present, a hard
ownership lock whose previous model is outside the admitted pool returns
`503` instead of transferring ownership or forcing that model. Router-owned
Responses history becomes portable after the router has expanded it into the
complete stateless request; its retained `previous_response_id` alone does not
create a lock. An active tool loop still does. Unknown response IDs fail during
history lookup, before selection.

## Decision Boundaries

Most decisions do not need local configuration. Use `bypass` for hard policy
boundaries:

```yaml
routing:
  decisions:
    - name: local_privacy_policy
      description: Keep privacy-sensitive traffic on the local model.
      priority: 200
      modelRefs:
        - model: local-private-model
      adaptations:
        mode: bypass
```

Use `observe` to collect diagnostics without changing the final model:

```yaml
adaptations:
  protection:
    mode: observe
```

## Diagnostics

```http
x-vsr-learning-methods: protection
x-vsr-learning-actions: protection=hold_current
x-vsr-learning-scopes: protection=conversation
x-vsr-learning-reasons: protection=cache_cost_high
```

Client UIs should translate raw actions into user-facing text. For example,
`hold_current` can display as "kept run model", `allow_switch` as "switch
allowed", `rescue_switch` as "rescue switch", and `bypass` as "learning
bypassed".

Router Replay stores the full protection trace: identity source and hash,
protected model, base model, proposal model, final model, switch cost, cache
evidence, tool-loop state, mode, scope, action, and reason.
