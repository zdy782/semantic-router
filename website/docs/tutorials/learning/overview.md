# Router Learning

## Overview

Router Learning is the router layer for cross-request routing intelligence. It
adjusts the model proposed by semantic decisions without making online state
part of `decision.algorithm`.

The public concepts are:

- `global.router.learning.adaptation`: online model-choice learning.
- `global.router.learning.protection`: session and conversation stability.
- `routing.decisions[].adaptations`: per-decision apply, observe, or bypass
  controls.
- Router Replay: optional diagnostics and outcomes for offline recipe learning;
  persistence requires a durable replay backend.

Use Router Learning when a decision should remain semantic, but repeated
requests should consider current model, tool-loop state, prefix-cache evidence,
handoff cost, switch history, or runtime outcomes.

## Key Advantages

- Keeps semantic decisions readable and request-local.
- Gives online model-choice learning and stability protection one shared
  runtime pipeline.
- Lets hard policy decisions bypass learning without changing route rules.
- Records compact response headers and, when replay is enabled, detailed
  Router Replay diagnostics.
- Supports offline analysis that can identify routing problems and evaluate
  recipe changes before deployment.

## What Problem Does It Solve?

Semantic decisions are good at matching the current request, but they do not
remember whether a model was overprovisioned, underpowered, unstable, or expensive in
similar agent flows. Router Learning adds bounded online state and replay-linked
outcomes so the router can improve model choice while keeping recipes in
control.

## When to Use

- Your recipe has multiple candidate models and runtime evidence should improve
  the choice.
- Agent sessions need stability across tool loops, prefix cache, or provider
  state.
- Sensitive decisions need an explicit bypass from online learning.
- You want explicitly configured replay and outcomes to power offline recipe
  experiments.

## Configuration

When configuration omits a setting, the defaults are:

| Setting | Default |
| --- | --- |
| `global.router.learning.enabled` | `false`; the master switch must be enabled. |
| `adaptation.enabled` and `protection.enabled` | `true`, subject to the master switch. |
| `adaptation.candidate_set` | `decision` |
| `protection.scope` | `conversation` |
| Protection identity headers | `x-session-id` and `x-conversation-id` |

The repository's reference `config/config.yaml` explicitly enables learning and
both components. Built-in recipes inherit the active base configuration; choosing
a recipe does not enable the master switch. When protection is enabled but its
configured identity is missing, it records diagnostics and leaves routing
unprotected. See [session identification](../../api/session-identification).

```yaml
global:
  router:
    learning:
      enabled: true
      adaptation:
        enabled: true
        strategy: routing_sampling
        candidate_set: decision
      protection:
        enabled: true
        scope: conversation
        identity:
          headers:
            session: x-session-id
            conversation: x-conversation-id
        tuning:
          idle_timeout_seconds: 300
          switch_margin: 0.05
          stability_weight: 1.0
      state_store:
        backend: redis
        ttl_seconds: 86400
        timeout_ms: 50
        redis:
          address: redis:6379
          database: 2
          key_prefix: "vsr:router-session:v1:"
```

The shared store is optional. Request-time reads use a strict timeout and fail
open to the bounded local store. Response-side updates write the same snapshot
to Redis so another replica can recover conversation protection state.

Decision-local controls are sparse. Most decisions inherit global behavior:

```yaml
adaptations:
  mode: bypass
```

Use `bypass` for privacy, security, local-only, compliance, or any other hard
policy route. Use component-level controls when one component should observe or
bypass independently:

```yaml
adaptations:
  adaptation:
    mode: observe
  protection:
    mode: apply
    stability_weight: 1.5
```

## Runtime Flow

```text
base selector
  -> protection preflight
  -> adaptation
  -> protection switch guard
  -> final model
```

Adaptation answers which model looks better from experience. Protection answers
whether exploration or switching is safe now.

## Header And Replay

The `x-vsr-learning-*` header family is intentionally compact:

```http
x-vsr-learning-methods: adaptation,protection
x-vsr-learning-actions: adaptation=propose_switch,protection=allow_switch
x-vsr-learning-scopes: protection=conversation
x-vsr-learning-reasons: adaptation=sampled_win,protection=switch_allowed
```

When Router Replay is enabled, detailed fields such as base model, proposal
model, final model, cache warmth, switch cost, candidate scores, sampling
values, and hashed identity diagnostics are stored there and keyed by
`x-vsr-replay-id`.

## Evaluate Recipe Changes Offline

Router Learning does not rewrite deployed recipes on the request path. Use the
offline recipe-learning command to turn replay and outcomes into findings,
metrics, candidate variants, experiment estimates, suggested changes, and
experience seed packs:

```bash
vllm-sr optimize recipe-learning \
  --endpoint http://localhost:8080 \
  --recipe-file config.yaml \
  --output-dir ./router-learning-report
```

`--endpoint` targets the Router management API, never the public inference
listener. Export `VSR_MGMT_TOKEN` first when management bearer auth is enabled.

For air-gapped or CI workflows, export replay JSON first and pass it with
`--replay-file`. Add `--cases-file` when eval cases include expected decisions
or models.
