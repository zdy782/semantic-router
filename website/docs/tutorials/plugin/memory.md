# Memory

## Overview

`memory` is a route-local plugin for retrieving and storing conversation memory.

## Key Advantages

- Keeps memory behavior local to the routes that benefit from it.
- Supports retrieval and auto-store in one plugin.
- Separates route-local memory policy from shared backing-store config.

## What Problem Does It Solve?

Not every route should pay the complexity or privacy cost of retrieval memory. `memory` lets one matched route retrieve and store conversation context while the shared store remains configured under `global.stores.memory`. Session-aware model stability is a separate Router Learning adaptation configured under `global.router.learning`.

## When to Use

- a route should retrieve prior conversation context
- the route should automatically store useful new turns
- memory settings should stay local to one route family

## Configuration

The memory plugin requires a backing store configured under `global.stores.memory`. The router supports three backends:

- **Milvus** (default) — distributed vector database, best for large-scale production
- **Valkey** — lightweight single-binary option using the Search module, best for dev/test or existing Valkey infra
- **Qdrant** — single-binary with gRPC, simpler ops than Milvus, good for small-to-large workloads

See the [Stores and Tools](../global/stores-and-tools) tutorial for global memory configuration, the [Valkey Memory deployment guide](../../installation/valkey-memory) for Valkey-specific setup, or the [Qdrant deployment guide](../../installation/qdrant) for Qdrant-specific setup.

Add the plugin under `routing.decisions[].plugins`:

```yaml
plugins:
  - type: memory
    configuration:
      enabled: true
      retrieval_limit: 5
      similarity_threshold: 0.72
      auto_store: true
```

Memory can persist request-derived content and send retrieved memories to the
selected model. Choose user/tenant isolation, retention, authentication, and
transport security appropriate for that data. Thresholds depend on the
embedding model. See a complete example:
[`config/fragments/plugin/memory/session-memory.yaml`](https://github.com/vllm-project/semantic-router/blob/main/config/fragments/plugin/memory/session-memory.yaml).

## Upgrading the embedding model

Restart the model runtime after changing embedding weights. For local `mmbert`
models, including Vela Embedding, the router binds memory to
the loaded model, tokenizer, inference settings, and vector dimension. Changing
these creates a separate physical collection or index and a separate Redis hot
cache. Restarting with the same representation reuses its existing storage.
Your configured logical names remain unchanged.

Earlier untagged collections are preserved, but are not adopted automatically:
equal vector dimensions do not prove that two models produce compatible
embeddings. Export the original memory content and ingest it with the new model
before relying on historical retrieval. No old collection is deleted during
startup or model migration. This automatic identity binding currently covers
local `mmbert`; other embedding providers keep their existing behavior.
