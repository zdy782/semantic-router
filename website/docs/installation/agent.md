title: Install with an agent
description: Give an agent one prompt to install, configure, and verify vLLM Semantic Router through its CLI and Router API.

} from '@site/src/data/installation'

# Install with an agent

Paste this prompt into a coding agent that can use a terminal and access the
machine where you want to run vLLM Semantic Router:

<CodeBlock language="text">{AGENT_INSTALL_PROMPT}</CodeBlock>

That is the complete bootstrap prompt. It points the agent to the public,
self-contained <a href={AGENT_SKILL_PATH}>vLLM SR Skill</a>; installation details
stay in the Skill instead of being copied into every prompt. The Dashboard is
optional; the agent can verify it when you request Dashboard or Playground work.

## What the agent does

The Skill directs the agent to:

1. Inspect the host, existing installation, container runtime, accelerator, and
   available model endpoints without changing them.
2. Install the latest published dev CLI when needed, then verify its supported
   commands before changing a runtime. Discover configuration progressively from
   the CLI and the selected Router's schema and OpenAPI contract.
3. Create or update canonical YAML for the available model pool while keeping
   credentials in environment variables. Reuse packaged built-in Recipes through
   `vllm-sr recipe builtin list`, `export`, and `init` when requested.
4. For a new stack, validate locally, launch, and wait for readiness. For an
   existing stack, validate and plan before applying; listener or provider
   topology changes require an authorized deployment restart.
5. Preview the routing decision without backend generation, then send a real
   end-to-end request through the routed inference endpoint.
6. Leave the config path, active revision, validation result, and routing
   evidence for review.

Tell the agent your model endpoint URLs, routing objective, or deployment
constraints in the same message when they are already known. Otherwise, the
agent will discover what it can and ask only when a choice or permission is
required.

## Direct contracts

The agent works against the same contracts used by the CLI and Dashboard.
Dashboard verification is optional and uses real server responses and streamed
Playground output when requested.

| Purpose | CLI or Router contract |
| --- | --- |
| Discover operations | `GET /api/v1?audience=agent&visibility=primary` |
| Inspect an operation | `GET /openapi.json?path=...&method=...` |
| Discover configuration | `vllm-sr config schema` or `GET /api/v1/config/schema` |
| Discover packaged Recipes | `vllm-sr recipe builtin list` |
| First launch | `vllm-sr config validate`, then `vllm-sr serve` and readiness |
| Plan an existing-stack change | `vllm-sr config validate`, then `vllm-sr config plan` |
| Apply a hot-reloadable change | `vllm-sr config apply`, which plans again before applying |
| Test routing logic | `vllm-sr route preview` |
| Test the complete data path | `vllm-sr route probe` |

The management origin serves health, discovery, configuration, and OpenAPI.
The routed inference origin separately serves OpenAI-compatible requests. An
agent must discover both rather than infer one from the other.

## Safety boundaries

- Keep API keys and provider credentials in environment variables; do not put
  secret values in prompts, YAML, command arguments, or logs.
- Keep changes within the requested deployment and existing authorization;
  obtain missing authorization before destructive changes, public exposure, or
  disruption of an unrelated service.
- A routing preview runs routing signals without backend generation. A route
  probe is the end-to-end check that reaches the selected backend.
- Use the running Router's discovery, schema, and OpenAPI responses as the
  authority for its installed version.

For deeper configuration work, continue with the
[configuration contract](configuration-contract) and
[configuration workflows](configuration-workflows). For model and
Mixture-of-Models evaluation, use the
[agent evaluation loop](../benchmarking/agent-evaluation-loop).

## Maintaining the Skill

The single authored source is
[`tools/agent/skills/vllm-sr-agent-operations/`](https://github.com/vllm-project/semantic-router/tree/main/tools/agent/skills/vllm-sr-agent-operations),
including its optional references. Edit those files and run
`make agent-skill-sync`; do not edit the public copies directly. The generator
changes only the public skill name and relative reference links to absolute URLs
on the same site. Commit the generated files alongside their source; the website
publishes those static files directly. A remote agent can load each reference
without a repository checkout.

`make agent-skill-check`, pre-commit, and `make harness-check` reject missing or
stale generated files. The repository and website therefore share one workflow
while keeping their respective skill names and installation paths.
