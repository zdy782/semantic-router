title: Configuration
description: Understand the canonical v0.3 YAML document and where routing, providers, recipes, services, and secrets belong.

# Configuration

Semantic Router uses one canonical YAML document across the CLI, Dashboard,
Helm, and Operator. The top-level structure is:

```yaml
version:
listeners:
providers:
evaluation:
routing:
entrypoints:
recipes:
global:
```

Most deployments begin with `version`, `listeners`, `providers`, and one
top-level `routing` profile. Add `entrypoints` and `recipes` when one deployment
needs several isolated policies. Add `global` settings only for shared services
or runtime behavior that differs from the built-in defaults.

## What belongs where

| Section | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| `version` | Canonical schema version. Use `v0.3`. |
| `listeners` | Public Router listeners and timeouts. |
| `providers` | Logical provider models, physical backend endpoints, pricing, capabilities, and defaults. |
| `evaluation` | Optional operator-owned benchmark definitions, versioned index DAGs, and model-linked records. |
| `routing` | The default recipe: model cards, signals, projections, decisions, strategy, algorithms, and route plugins. |
| `entrypoints` | Public virtual model aliases mapped to named recipes. |
| `recipes` | Additional isolated routing profiles that share providers and global infrastructure. |
| `global` | Router services, stores, integrations, observability, learning, and router-owned model assets. |

Keep these boundaries clear:

- signals detect facts;
- projections combine evidence;
- decisions define eligibility and route policy;
- algorithms choose or coordinate candidate models;
- plugins add behavior at route-specific hook points; and
- providers bind logical model names to inference endpoints.

Provider pricing belongs beside each concrete model under
`providers.models[].pricing`. It accepts an optional uppercase three-letter
`currency` plus non-negative `prompt_per_1m`, `completion_per_1m`,
`cached_input_per_1m`, and `cache_write_per_1m` rates. Routing model cards do not
repeat deployment prices or credentials.

Evaluation measurements belong in `evaluation.records[]` and reference a
canonical Model Card identity through `model`. Built-in benchmark IDs work
directly; define new benchmark semantics and indices beside the records under
`evaluation`. See [Custom evaluations](../benchmarking/custom-evaluations).

Use [Protocol Compatibility](protocol-compatibility) to choose the model's
backend `api_format`. Then see
[Backend Target Compatibility](backend-target-compatibility) before moving its
bindings between Docker, Helm, the Operator, and Dashboard workflows. The
target matrix distinguishes canonical pass-through from Kubernetes discovery
and records which URL, path, weight, and provider fields each surface
preserves.

Router-wide debugging surfaces stay closed by default.
`global.services.observability.profiling` serves Go `pprof` endpoints, and only
when it is explicitly enabled; it then binds `127.0.0.1:6060` so profiles never
reach a routable interface without an explicit `bind` change. The switch is read
once at startup, so changing it requires a Router restart. See
[API and Observability](../tutorials/global/api-and-observability).

Built-in category/domain classification uses the local `variant` selector when
no remote backend is configured. To call a named external classifier, attach a
`backend` under `global.model_catalog.modules.classifier.domain` and resolve
its `model` from `global.model_catalog.external[]` with
`model_role: classification`. The shared backend fields are `protocol`,
`contract`, `model`, and optional `deadline_ms`; category
currently supports `http_classify` with the full `label_distribution.v1`
response contract. Omit `backend` to retain local behavior. The deprecated
`use_modernbert` and `use_mmbert_32k` keys remain readable, while generated
canonical configuration uses `variant: candle`, `variant: modernbert`, or
`variant: mmbert32k`.

Complexity attaches the same block under
`global.model_catalog.modules.complexity`, beside `prototype_scoring`. It reads
two contracts, so `contract` cannot be defaulted and must be stated:
`score.v1` for a regression model, where each rule turns the score into a
verdict through its own `hard_above`/`easy_below` boundaries (or
`hard_below`/`easy_above` for a score that falls as difficulty rises), and
`label_distribution.v1` for a model that returns `hard`/`easy`/`medium`
directly. `threshold` remains the symmetric shorthand for the local signed
margin. `score.v1` reports no confidence, so decisions gated on those rules
rank on the engine's structural default; the Router warns at startup. The
remote call is visible through `llm_remote_connector_*` and
`llm_complexity_*` metrics, and a scorer failure is recorded on every
complexity rule's signal errors rather than dropped.

PII attaches the same block under
`global.model_catalog.modules.classifier.pii`. It reads one contract,
`token_spans.v1`, so `contract` may be omitted. The remote model returns entity
spans as code-point offsets into the exact request string it was sent, and
every label it returns must exist in the configured `pii_mapping_path`; a
response the contract rejects is a backend failure rather than a clean "no PII"
result. `on_error` beside the backend selects what such a failure, or a
provider-declared `truncated_at`, does to the rule that consumed it: `allow`
(the default) treats the content as not matching, `block` matches it as
`classification_error`. Spans returned before a declared truncation still
count under both policies. A backend is mutually exclusive with the local
`use_mmbert_32k` selector.

The [Routing Pipeline](../overview/signal-driven-decisions) explains the design.
Capability pages under **Capabilities** document each signal, projection,
decision, algorithm, plugin, and global block.

## Capability catalog

Use this catalog to choose a reusable building block, then open its guide for
configuration details. The inventory comes from `config/fragments/`; each
one-line goal comes from the matching guide's **Overview**. The documentation
build regenerates this block and fails if the checked-in catalog has drifted.

### Model configuration

Models can inherit identity and reasoning from the built-in catalog or define a
private model locally. This catalog-backed example lets the selected Provider
mapping supply the native model ID, protocol, reasoning transport, and request
path:

```yaml
providers:
  defaults:
    model: production
    reasoning_effort: medium
  models:
    - name: production
      catalog: openai/gpt-5.6-sol
      backend_refs:
        - provider: openai
          api_key_env: OPENAI_API_KEY
```

The `name` remains the local Router alias. A private or newly released model
omits `catalog` and can optionally define a Model Card and reasoning contract
under that alias. Start with [Configure models](model-configuration), then use
[Model configuration patterns](model-configuration-patterns) to compare the
catalog, custom, reasoning, Provider, and replica combinations. The
[Model and provider Day-0 guide](../community/model-provider-day-0-support.md)
is for contributors adding reusable support to the repository catalog.

Classifier backend failures remain `Unknown` while the complete boolean tree
is evaluated. Set `rules.on_unknown` to `no_match`, `match`, or `fail_request`
to resolve an undetermined terminal result. Omitting it preserves the existing
classifier-family error behavior.

Requests using an automatic model alias enter the default `routing` profile.
A concrete provider model name is a direct pass-through request and bypasses
recipe signals, decisions, route plugins, cache, learning, and session routing.

## Validate and serve

```bash
vllm-sr config validate --config config.yaml
vllm-sr serve --config config.yaml
```

Validation catches schema errors, unresolved references, incompatible recipe
boundaries, invalid provider bindings, and unsupported plugin or algorithm
settings before the Router starts.

For portable model-free Recipes, set
`routing.decisions[].algorithm.minimum_candidates` to the smallest pool that
preserves the decision's intended behavior. Empty built-in assets remain
valid, while a published Entrypoint is rejected if its concrete assignments do
not meet the declared cardinality.

## Environment references and secrets

Keep credentials outside the YAML file:

```yaml
api_key: ${MODEL_API_KEY}
```

Supported string substitutions are:

- `${VAR}` and `$VAR`;
- `${VAR:-default}` when `VAR` is unset or empty;
- `${VAR-default}` when `VAR` is unset; and
- `$$` for a literal `$`.

For a custom Recipe, authorize required host variables explicitly with
`--recipe-env NAME`. Kubernetes deployments place sensitive environment values
in Secrets rather than ConfigMaps or Helm values. See
[Security Hardening](security-hardening).

## Entrypoints and recipes

An entrypoint maps one or more public model aliases to a recipe. A recipe owns
its signal, projection, decision, algorithm, plugin, cache, replay, learning,
and routing state. Providers, stores, and router-owned classifier assets may be
shared without allowing policy state to cross recipe boundaries.

Set `max_response_bytes` on external LLM classifier entries and the MCP
classifier module to cap one upstream classifier response.

In the schema, `entrypoints[].model_names` lists the public aliases,
`entrypoints[].recipe` selects a named recipe, and `recipes[].routing` contains
that recipe's policy.

If no decision matches, the recipe uses `providers.defaults.model`.
The virtual entrypoint name never reaches a backend.

See
[Models, Entrypoints, and Serving](../tutorials/global/models-entrypoints-serving)
for built-in virtual models, CLI serving, backend binding, forking, packaging,
and migration. See
[Virtual Models](../tutorials/global/entrypoints-and-recipes)
for the complete schema.

## Configuration workflows

The canonical document can be authored or applied through several interfaces:

- local CLI and YAML;
- Dashboard setup and visual routing tools;
- Helm or `vllm-sr serve --target k8s`;
- the Kubernetes Operator; and
- the routing DSL.

[Configuration Workflows](configuration-workflows) explains which interface
owns which part of the document and how to avoid competing sources of truth.
[Configuration Contract](configuration-contract) describes the generated
machine-readable schema, Router discovery and validation APIs, and the safe
authoring loop for tools and agents.

## Reference sources

- [`config/config.yaml`](https://github.com/vllm-project/semantic-router/blob/main/config/config.yaml)
  is the exhaustive canonical example.
- [`config/fragments/`](https://github.com/vllm-project/semantic-router/tree/main/config/fragments)
  contains reusable signal, decision, algorithm, and plugin fragments.
- [Providers and routing tutorials](../tutorials/global/overview) describe
  shared runtime configuration.
- [Unified Config Contract v0.3](../proposals/unified-config-contract-v0-3)
  records the design behind the current contract.
- [Configuration Contract](configuration-contract) is the live discovery and
  validation contract for the current Router build.

Avoid copying the exhaustive example as an application config. Start with the
smallest document that describes the deployment, then add only the capabilities
and services it uses.
